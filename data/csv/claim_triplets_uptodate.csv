This topic will cover the issues related to monitoring of HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis (TB), including directly observed therapy, the clinical response to treatment, adverse events related to treatment, duration of treatment, and prognosis. Issues related to clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of susceptible TB in HIV-infected patients are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-infected adults: Initiation of therapy"" and ""Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in adults"".) INITIATION OF THERAPY — Issues related to selection of antituberculous therapy and antiretroviral therapy are discussed separately. (See ""Treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-infected adults: Initiation of therapy"".) DURATION OF THERAPY — The standard duration of therapy for treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary TB in HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is six months. This includes an intensive phase of four drugs (isoniazid, a rifamycin [eg, rifampin or rifabutin], pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) administered for two months, followed by a continuation phase of two drugs (isoniazid and a rifamycin) administered for four months [1,2]. All HIV-infected patients should be started on ART during treatment of tuberculosis. Issues related to timing of therapy are discussed separately. (See ""Treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-infected adults: Initiation of therapy"", section on 'Timing'.) In rare instances in which ART is not administered during antituberculous therapy (ie, if ART is not available or if there are unavoidable concerns regarding drug interactions), the continuation phase of antituberculous therapy should be extended for an additional three months (ie, a continuation phase of seven months, corresponding to a total of nine months of antituberculous therapy) [2]. Further study is needed to address the optimal duration of antituberculous therapy in HIV-infected patients. In a 2012 meta-analysis including 6 randomized trials and 21 cohort studies, relapse was more common among patients whose regimens included two months of rifamycin than among patients whose regimens included at least eight months of rifamycin (adjusted risk ratio 5.0, 95% CI 1.9-13.2). The risk of relapse was lower with rifampin treatment for ≥9 months compared with 6 months of rifampin (pooled risk difference -9.1 percent, 95% CI -16.5 to -1.8 percent) [3,4]. However, available antiretroviral therapy has improved substantially since this study was performed [2]. For those patients with cavitary disease and positive sputum cultures after two months of treatment, the duration of the continuation phase should be extended from four to seven months (total duration of treatment extended from six to nine months) [1,2]. No further adjustments in duration of therapy are warranted for patients who did not receive ART during antituberculous therapy (ie, total duration of antituberculous therapy nine months). Issues related to duration of therapy for HIV-infected patients with drug-resistant TB are discussed separately. (See ""Treatment of drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis in adults"".) CLINICAL MONITORING — HIV-infected patients with TB generally respond well to therapy if the diagnosis is made promptly and standard therapy instituted. Fever usually resolves within one month; improvement in chest radiograph findings may take longer. Sputum monitoring — During treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, sputum should be obtained for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture at monthly intervals until two consecutive cultures are negative [2]. Sputum AFB smear and culture at the end of the intensive phase (after two months of treatment) is particularly important for assessing relapse risk and for determining the duration of the continuation phase (algorithm 1). The approach in the setting of persistently positive sputum culture is discussed below. (See 'Persistently positive sputum culture' below.) After the sputum smear has converted to negative, at least one sputum should be collected at the completion of therapy to confirm that the patient has remained smear and culture negative [1]. Drug-related side effects — Antituberculous drugs are associated with a broad array of adverse effects, and the likelihood of adverse effects may be increased in HIV-infected patients [5].","The standard treatment duration for drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy is established as six months, comprising an intensive phase of four drugs followed by a continuation phase of two drugs.",The risk of relapse in patients with tuberculosis is the same regardless of whether they receive rifamycin for two months or at least eight months.,"While HIV-infected patients typically respond well to tuberculosis therapy, the time it takes for improvement in chest radiograph findings can vary significantly from case to case."

DURATION OF THERAPY — The standard duration of therapy for treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary TB in HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is six months. This includes an intensive phase of four drugs (isoniazid, a rifamycin [eg, rifampin or rifabutin], pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) administered for two months, followed by a continuation phase of two drugs (isoniazid and a rifamycin) administered for four months [1,2]. All HIV-infected patients should be started on ART during treatment of tuberculosis. Issues related to timing of therapy are discussed separately. (See ""Treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-infected adults: Initiation of therapy"", section on 'Timing'.) In rare instances in which ART is not administered during antituberculous therapy (ie, if ART is not available or if there are unavoidable concerns regarding drug interactions), the continuation phase of antituberculous therapy should be extended for an additional three months (ie, a continuation phase of seven months, corresponding to a total of nine months of antituberculous therapy) [2]. Further study is needed to address the optimal duration of antituberculous therapy in HIV-infected patients. In a 2012 meta-analysis including 6 randomized trials and 21 cohort studies, relapse was more common among patients whose regimens included two months of rifamycin than among patients whose regimens included at least eight months of rifamycin (adjusted risk ratio 5.0, 95% CI 1.9-13.2). The risk of relapse was lower with rifampin treatment for ≥9 months compared with 6 months of rifampin (pooled risk difference -9.1 percent, 95% CI -16.5 to -1.8 percent) [3,4]. However, available antiretroviral therapy has improved substantially since this study was performed [2]. For those patients with cavitary disease and positive sputum cultures after two months of treatment, the duration of the continuation phase should be extended from four to seven months (total duration of treatment extended from six to nine months) [1,2]. No further adjustments in duration of therapy are warranted for patients who did not receive ART during antituberculous therapy (ie, total duration of antituberculous therapy nine months). Issues related to duration of therapy for HIV-infected patients with drug-resistant TB are discussed separately. (See ""Treatment of drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis in adults"".) CLINICAL MONITORING — HIV-infected patients with TB generally respond well to therapy if the diagnosis is made promptly and standard therapy instituted. Fever usually resolves within one month; improvement in chest radiograph findings may take longer. Sputum monitoring — During treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, sputum should be obtained for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture at monthly intervals until two consecutive cultures are negative [2]. Sputum AFB smear and culture at the end of the intensive phase (after two months of treatment) is particularly important for assessing relapse risk and for determining the duration of the continuation phase (algorithm 1). The approach in the setting of persistently positive sputum culture is discussed below. (See 'Persistently positive sputum culture' below.) After the sputum smear has converted to negative, at least one sputum should be collected at the completion of therapy to confirm that the patient has remained smear and culture negative [1]. Drug-related side effects — Antituberculous drugs are associated with a broad array of adverse effects, and the likelihood of adverse effects may be increased in HIV-infected patients [5].",Prompt diagnosis and initiation of standard therapy are crucial for ensuring a positive response to treatment in HIV-infected patients with TB.,The risk of relapse is not affected by the duration of rifampin treatment in HIV-infected individuals with tuberculosis.,"Although the current antiretroviral therapy has improved significantly, its interaction with antituberculous medications can create uncertain treatment scenarios."

● The approach to monitoring the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patient with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) on antituberculous medications must include consideration of the antituberculous regimen, the antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen, potential drug reactions, and complications related to the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). (See 'Introduction' above.)
● Issues related to selection of antituberculous therapy and antiretroviral therapy are discussed separately. (See ""Treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-infected adults: Initiation of therapy"".)
● The standard duration of therapy for treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary TB in HIV-infected patients on ART is six months. This includes an intensive phase of four drugs (isoniazid, a rifamycin [eg, rifampin or rifabutin], pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) administered for two months, followed by a continuation phase of two drugs (isoniazid and a rifamycin) administered for four months. (See 'Duration of therapy' above.)
● In rare instances in which ART is not administered during antituberculous therapy (ie, ART is not available or there are unavoidable concerns regarding drug interactions), the continuation phase should be extended for an additional three months (ie, a continuation phase of seven months), corresponding to a total of nine months of antituberculous therapy. (See 'Duration of therapy' above.)
● During treatment of pulmonary TB, sputum should be obtained for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture at monthly intervals until two consecutive cultures are negative. Sputum AFB smear and culture at the end of the intensive phase (after two months of treatment) is particularly important for assessing relapse risk and for determining the duration of the continuation phase (algorithm 1). (See 'Sputum monitoring' above.)
● Patient education regarding symptoms of hepatitis and other possible drug toxicities should be reinforced at each follow-up visit, at least monthly. Patients should be instructed to report signs or symptoms of toxicity immediately and stop antituberculous medications until advised to resume. (See 'Drug-related side effects' above.)

Uterine sarcomas arise from dividing cell populations in the myometrium or connective tissue elements within the endometrium. Compared with the more common endometrial carcinomas (epithelial neoplasms), uterine sarcomas, particularly leiomyosarcomas (connective tissue neoplasms), behave aggressively and are associated with a poorer prognosis. (See ""Endometrial carcinoma: Pretreatment evaluation, staging, and surgical treatment"".) The classification, clinical manifestations, and staging of uterine sarcomas that arise in adults (eg, endometrial stromal sarcomas, leiomyosarcoma, adenosarcoma) are reviewed here. Staging and treatment of endometrial stromal tumors and leiomyosarcoma are discussed separately. Carcinosarcoma, which is no longer classified as a sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma, which typically arises in children and adolescents, are also discussed separately. (See ""Treatment and prognosis of uterine leiomyosarcoma"" and ""Classification and treatment of endometrial stromal sarcoma and uterine adenosarcoma"" and ""Clinical features, diagnosis, staging, and treatment of uterine carcinosarcoma"" and ""Rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood and adolescence: Epidemiology, pathology, and molecular pathogenesis"".) CLASSIFICATION — The World Health Organization  and College of American Pathologists  have published classification systems for uterine sarcomas. The histologic classification of these neoplasms is based upon the differentiation/growth pattern of the neoplastic cells and their presumed cell of origin. Uterine sarcomas are referred to as homologous or heterologous. The majority are homologous (ie, differentiate in ways similar to normal uterine tissues), including endometrium (endometrial stromal sarcomas), muscle (leiomyosarcoma), or sarcomas of nonspecific supporting tissue (eg, connective tissue, blood vessels, lymphatics). By contrast, heterologous tumors contain elements with non-native differentiation (eg, skeletal muscle, cartilage, bone). Historically, uterine carcinosarcoma was classified as a type of uterine sarcoma and was termed malignant mixed müllerian tumor or mixed mesodermal sarcoma. However, these neoplasms are now classified as carcinomas since they derive from a monoclonal neoplastic cell, which has more characteristics of epithelial than stromal neoplasms. In addition, the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical behavior associated with carcinosarcoma suggest a closer relationship to endometrial carcinoma than to sarcoma. (See ""Clinical features, diagnosis, staging, and treatment of uterine carcinosarcoma"".) HISTOPATHOLOGYNonepithelial neoplasmsEndometrial stromal and related tumors — Endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESS) are uterine mesenchymal neoplasms with malignant potential. Historically, they were characterized as either low-grade or high-grade ESS. However, high-grade endometrial stromal tumors are now referred to as undifferentiated endometrial sarcomas (UES) or high-grade undifferentiated uterine sarcomas (HGUS), reflecting their composition of anaplastic cells with little or no evidence of endometrial stromal differentiation. The term endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) is primarily limited to neoplasms previously referred to as ""low grade."" Some observers believe there is a distinct entity of high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (distinct from undifferentiated uterine sarcoma); however, this is controversial. (See ""Classification and treatment of endometrial stromal sarcoma and uterine adenosarcoma"", section on 'Histopathology'.) Leiomyosarcoma — Leiomyosarcomas typically (though not always) have prominent cellular atypia, abundant mitoses (≥10 per 10 high power fields), and areas of coagulative necrosis (-B). Epithelial neoplasms have a clearly defined behavior (invasion) that indicates metastatic potential. Because smooth muscle neoplasms arise in the stroma (do not live in a compartment), they are more difficult to distinguish as benign (without metastatic potential) or malignant (with metastatic potential). Cellular atypia, mitosis, and ""coagulative necrosis"" are known as the Stanford criteria (originally described by the Stanford group). In the largest retrospective study, which resulted in the development of these criteria, the presence of two of the three features indicated a risk of metastatic spread of >10 percent  [3]. However, opinions vary as to the exact level of mitotic activity required for diagnosis of sarcoma [4]. Other common features, which are not diagnostic in isolation but may be used in borderline cases, are hypercellularity and infiltrative border [4]. Leiomyosarcomas typically are large (>10 cm) yellow or tan solitary masses with soft, fleshy cut surfaces with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis [5]. The mass may bulge into the uterine cavity, but the epicenter is in the myometrium. Leiomyosarcomas and leiomyomas are independent entities. Leiomyosarcomas are rare and while they may coexist in the same uterus with benign leiomyomas (fibroids), they exhibit differing cytogenetic abnormalities [6-8], and leiomyomas do not appear to be the precursor to leiomyosarcomas. Both neoplasms may express estrogen and progesterone receptors. Series of 20 or more leiomyosarcomas have reported estrogen receptors in 48 to 57 percent and progesterone receptors in 30 to 43 percent [9,10]. (See ""Differentiating uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) from uterine sarcomas"", section on 'Do leiomyomas progress to sarcoma?'.) There are two variant forms of leiomyosarcoma:
● Epithelioid leiomyosarcoma – Epithelioid leiomyosarcoma is characterized by round to polygonal cells with abundant eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm [11]. Epithelioid leiomyomas with atypia and ≥5 mitoses per 10 high power fields qualify as leiomyosarcoma. The absence of coagulative necrosis does not confirm benign behavior in these neoplasms. The clinical behavior is not well established for large (>6 cm) epithelioid smooth muscle neoplasms with moderate mitotic activity (two to four mitoses per 10 high power fields). Such neoplasms should be classified as epithelioid smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential (see below). ● Myxoid leiomyosarcomas – Myxoid leiomyosarcomas do not fit well into the Stanford scheme and are classified separately. The myxoid appearance may obscure the smooth muscle differentiation, the extent of nuclear pleomorphism, and the true number of mitotic figures. Although myxoid leiomyomas and smooth muscle neoplasms with prominent myxoid features must be thoroughly evaluated, particularly for mitosis because despite their apparently bland features, these neoplasms may behave in a highly malignant manner [12]. Benign histologic variants of leiomyomas and smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential are discussed separately. (See ""Variants of uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)"", section on 'Benign variants of leiomyomas' and ""Variants of uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)"", section on 'Smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential'.) Mixed endometrial stromal and smooth muscle tumor — These neoplasms, also referred to as stromomyomas, are defined as having at least 30 percent each of endometrial stromal and smooth muscle components [13]. There are few data regarding these lesions [13,14].","Uterine sarcomas, particularly leiomyosarcomas, are known to behave aggressively and are linked to a poorer prognosis compared to more common endometrial carcinomas.",The classification of carcinosarcoma as a type of uterine sarcoma is still accepted in current medical literature despite it being reclassified as a carcinoma.,"While some experts argue that high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma is a distinct entity, this view remains controversial among pathologists."

Uterine sarcomas arise from dividing cell populations in the myometrium or connective tissue elements within the endometrium. Compared with the more common endometrial carcinomas (epithelial neoplasms), uterine sarcomas, particularly leiomyosarcomas (connective tissue neoplasms), behave aggressively and are associated with a poorer prognosis. (See ""Endometrial carcinoma: Pretreatment evaluation, staging, and surgical treatment"".) The classification, clinical manifestations, and staging of uterine sarcomas that arise in adults (eg, endometrial stromal sarcomas, leiomyosarcoma, adenosarcoma) are reviewed here. Staging and treatment of endometrial stromal tumors and leiomyosarcoma are discussed separately. Carcinosarcoma, which is no longer classified as a sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma, which typically arises in children and adolescents, are also discussed separately. (See ""Treatment and prognosis of uterine leiomyosarcoma"" and ""Classification and treatment of endometrial stromal sarcoma and uterine adenosarcoma"" and ""Clinical features, diagnosis, staging, and treatment of uterine carcinosarcoma"" and ""Rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood and adolescence: Epidemiology, pathology, and molecular pathogenesis"".) CLASSIFICATION — The World Health Organization  and College of American Pathologists  have published classification systems for uterine sarcomas. The histologic classification of these neoplasms is based upon the differentiation/growth pattern of the neoplastic cells and their presumed cell of origin. Uterine sarcomas are referred to as homologous or heterologous. The majority are homologous (ie, differentiate in ways similar to normal uterine tissues), including endometrium (endometrial stromal sarcomas), muscle (leiomyosarcoma), or sarcomas of nonspecific supporting tissue (eg, connective tissue, blood vessels, lymphatics). By contrast, heterologous tumors contain elements with non-native differentiation (eg, skeletal muscle, cartilage, bone). Historically, uterine carcinosarcoma was classified as a type of uterine sarcoma and was termed malignant mixed müllerian tumor or mixed mesodermal sarcoma. However, these neoplasms are now classified as carcinomas since they derive from a monoclonal neoplastic cell, which has more characteristics of epithelial than stromal neoplasms. In addition, the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical behavior associated with carcinosarcoma suggest a closer relationship to endometrial carcinoma than to sarcoma. (See ""Clinical features, diagnosis, staging, and treatment of uterine carcinosarcoma"".) HISTOPATHOLOGYNonepithelial neoplasmsEndometrial stromal and related tumors — Endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESS) are uterine mesenchymal neoplasms with malignant potential. Historically, they were characterized as either low-grade or high-grade ESS. However, high-grade endometrial stromal tumors are now referred to as undifferentiated endometrial sarcomas (UES) or high-grade undifferentiated uterine sarcomas (HGUS), reflecting their composition of anaplastic cells with little or no evidence of endometrial stromal differentiation. The term endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) is primarily limited to neoplasms previously referred to as ""low grade."" Some observers believe there is a distinct entity of high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (distinct from undifferentiated uterine sarcoma); however, this is controversial. (See ""Classification and treatment of endometrial stromal sarcoma and uterine adenosarcoma"", section on 'Histopathology'.) Leiomyosarcoma — Leiomyosarcomas typically (though not always) have prominent cellular atypia, abundant mitoses (≥10 per 10 high power fields), and areas of coagulative necrosis (-B). Epithelial neoplasms have a clearly defined behavior (invasion) that indicates metastatic potential. Because smooth muscle neoplasms arise in the stroma (do not live in a compartment), they are more difficult to distinguish as benign (without metastatic potential) or malignant (with metastatic potential). Cellular atypia, mitosis, and ""coagulative necrosis"" are known as the Stanford criteria (originally described by the Stanford group). In the largest retrospective study, which resulted in the development of these criteria, the presence of two of the three features indicated a risk of metastatic spread of >10 percent  [3]. However, opinions vary as to the exact level of mitotic activity required for diagnosis of sarcoma [4]. Other common features, which are not diagnostic in isolation but may be used in borderline cases, are hypercellularity and infiltrative border [4]. Leiomyosarcomas typically are large (>10 cm) yellow or tan solitary masses with soft, fleshy cut surfaces with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis [5]. The mass may bulge into the uterine cavity, but the epicenter is in the myometrium. Leiomyosarcomas and leiomyomas are independent entities. Leiomyosarcomas are rare and while they may coexist in the same uterus with benign leiomyomas (fibroids), they exhibit differing cytogenetic abnormalities [6-8], and leiomyomas do not appear to be the precursor to leiomyosarcomas. Both neoplasms may express estrogen and progesterone receptors. Series of 20 or more leiomyosarcomas have reported estrogen receptors in 48 to 57 percent and progesterone receptors in 30 to 43 percent [9,10]. (See ""Differentiating uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) from uterine sarcomas"", section on 'Do leiomyomas progress to sarcoma?'.) There are two variant forms of leiomyosarcoma:
● Epithelioid leiomyosarcoma – Epithelioid leiomyosarcoma is characterized by round to polygonal cells with abundant eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm [11]. Epithelioid leiomyomas with atypia and ≥5 mitoses per 10 high power fields qualify as leiomyosarcoma. The absence of coagulative necrosis does not confirm benign behavior in these neoplasms. The clinical behavior is not well established for large (>6 cm) epithelioid smooth muscle neoplasms with moderate mitotic activity (two to four mitoses per 10 high power fields). Such neoplasms should be classified as epithelioid smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential (see below). ● Myxoid leiomyosarcomas – Myxoid leiomyosarcomas do not fit well into the Stanford scheme and are classified separately. The myxoid appearance may obscure the smooth muscle differentiation, the extent of nuclear pleomorphism, and the true number of mitotic figures. Although myxoid leiomyomas and smooth muscle neoplasms with prominent myxoid features must be thoroughly evaluated, particularly for mitosis because despite their apparently bland features, these neoplasms may behave in a highly malignant manner [12]. Benign histologic variants of leiomyomas and smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential are discussed separately. (See ""Variants of uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)"", section on 'Benign variants of leiomyomas' and ""Variants of uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)"", section on 'Smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential'.) Mixed endometrial stromal and smooth muscle tumor — These neoplasms, also referred to as stromomyomas, are defined as having at least 30 percent each of endometrial stromal and smooth muscle components [13].

Uterine sarcomas are aggressive, but many present at an early stage. In one series of over 1000 cases, the stage distribution was: stage I (60 percent), stage II and III (16 percent), and IV (22 percent)  [1]. RISK FACTORS — The rarity of uterine sarcoma has made it difficult to perform large studies to identify risk factors. Increasing age — The mean age at diagnosis is approximately 60 years old. However, uterine sarcomas have been diagnosed in women as young as 20 years old [20].

Another study found that decreased survival for black women with uterine sarcoma was accounted for by decreased use of appropriate radiation therapy, and survival was comparable for subjects receiving similar therapy [18]. Tamoxifen — Long-term use of tamoxifen (five years or more) appears to be associated with an increase in risk of developing uterine sarcoma [22-24]. The absolute risk remains small; breast cancer prevention randomized trials have found a risk of 17 per 100,000 woman-years of uterine sarcoma in women taking tamoxifen [25]. There is no known relationship between tamoxifen-associated endometrial polyps and uterine sarcoma. (See ""Endometrial polyps"", section on 'Tamoxifen'.) Multiple histologic subtypes of sarcomas have been reported following tamoxifen treatment, but generally, sarcomas present two to five years following the start of therapy and are often at an advanced stage at presentation [11,24]. (See ""Managing the side effects of tamoxifen"".) The risk of uterine sarcoma is included in a US Food and Drug Administration black box warning regarding tamoxifen [26].

./UTD2txt/5235.txt,"However, the use of diagnostic assays may be important in specific situations, as discussed below. The clinical manifestations of chickenpox and shingles are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Treatment of herpes zoster in the immunocompetent host"" and ""Clinical features of varicella-zoster virus infection: Chickenpox"" and ""Clinical manifestations of varicella-zoster virus infection: Herpes zoster"".) GENERAL BACKGROUND — The diagnosis of VZV infection is usually a clinical diagnosis based on the characteristic vesicular lesions, which are seen widespread in chickenpox (varicella) or in a restricted dermatomal pattern with associated neuritis in shingles (herpes zoster). However, additional diagnostic information may be useful in the following situations:
● Atypical rash in an immunocompromised host
● Possible disseminated disease in an immunosuppressed host without cutaneous lesionsIn addition, serologic testing may be necessary to determine if an individual at increased risk for varicella requires immunization (eg, a healthcare worker born after 1980 who does not have a history of childhood infection). POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION — The real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays provide uniformly rapid and sensitive confirmation of VZV from clinical specimens obtained from skin lesions and selected body fluids such as CSF and bronchoalveolar lavage [1,2]. In a study comparing viral culture isolation to real-time PCR [2], 110 clinical specimens from dermal lesions were analyzed using both methods. VZV was isolated by culture in 15 samples (14 percent) and VZV DNA was detected by PCR in 51 (46 percent) samples. In another study of patients with a high clinical suspicion of herpes zoster, real-time PCR testing was highly sensitive compared with culture (92 versus 53 percent) [3]. In addition, PCR-based testing was highly specific; no cross-reactivity was identified when tested against several other viruses. Real-time PCR allows for rapid viral amplification, limits risk of contamination, confers superior sensitivity in isolating VZV from an array of clinical specimens, and affords more rapid turnaround time compared with conventional culture techniques. PCR testing is also useful for a variety of other indications, such as making a diagnosis in a patient with vaccine-modified infection [4]. PCR testing of serum or blood may also be helpful in the transplant patient who has visceral disease prior to the appearance of cutaneous lesions [5]. DIRECT FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY — Rapid diagnosis of VZV infection can usually be accomplished by using DFA on scrapings from active vesicular skin lesions that have not yet crusted. The DFA test is widely available; it has lower cost compared to culture, and is associated with more rapid turnaround time [6,7]. As noted with culture techniques above, one DFA assay can simultaneously detect HSV and VZV with a 1.5 hour turnaround time [6]. VIRAL CULTURE — Virus isolation by culture is sometimes available but is insensitive and associated with low yield (approximately 60 to 75 percent) when compared with PCR testing [8]. Specific VZV culture isolation from a swab of vesicular skin lesion or sterile body fluid, such as CSF, typically requires prolonged incubation with a turnaround time of one to two weeks [6]. Sensitivity of culture also declines when lesions progress beyond the vesicular stage. SEROLOGIC TESTING — The presence of IgG antibodies to VZV correlates both with a history of varicella and protection against subsequent infection. Serologic testing has been employed in health care workers to assess susceptibility related to their potential risk of exposure.

(See ""Treatment of herpes zoster in the immunocompetent host"" and ""Clinical features of varicella-zoster virus infection: Chickenpox"" and ""Clinical manifestations of varicella-zoster virus infection: Herpes zoster"".) GENERAL BACKGROUND — The diagnosis of VZV infection is usually a clinical diagnosis based on the characteristic vesicular lesions, which are seen widespread in chickenpox (varicella) or in a restricted dermatomal pattern with associated neuritis in shingles (herpes zoster). However, additional diagnostic information may be useful in the following situations:
● Atypical rash in an immunocompromised host
● Possible disseminated disease in an immunosuppressed host without cutaneous lesionsIn addition, serologic testing may be necessary to determine if an individual at increased risk for varicella requires immunization (eg, a healthcare worker born after 1980 who does not have a history of childhood infection). POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION — The real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays provide uniformly rapid and sensitive confirmation of VZV from clinical specimens obtained from skin lesions and selected body fluids such as CSF and bronchoalveolar lavage [1,2]. In a study comparing viral culture isolation to real-time PCR [2], 110 clinical specimens from dermal lesions were analyzed using both methods. VZV was isolated by culture in 15 samples (14 percent) and VZV DNA was detected by PCR in 51 (46 percent) samples. In another study of patients with a high clinical suspicion of herpes zoster, real-time PCR testing was highly sensitive compared with culture (92 versus 53 percent) [3]. In addition, PCR-based testing was highly specific; no cross-reactivity was identified when tested against several other viruses. Real-time PCR allows for rapid viral amplification, limits risk of contamination, confers superior sensitivity in isolating VZV from an array of clinical specimens, and affords more rapid turnaround time compared with conventional culture techniques. PCR testing is also useful for a variety of other indications, such as making a diagnosis in a patient with vaccine-modified infection [4]. PCR testing of serum or blood may also be helpful in the transplant patient who has visceral disease prior to the appearance of cutaneous lesions [5]. DIRECT FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY — Rapid diagnosis of VZV infection can usually be accomplished by using DFA on scrapings from active vesicular skin lesions that have not yet crusted. The DFA test is widely available; it has lower cost compared to culture, and is associated with more rapid turnaround time [6,7]. As noted with culture techniques above, one DFA assay can simultaneously detect HSV and VZV with a 1.5 hour turnaround time [6]. VIRAL CULTURE — Virus isolation by culture is sometimes available but is insensitive and associated with low yield (approximately 60 to 75 percent) when compared with PCR testing [8]. Specific VZV culture isolation from a swab of vesicular skin lesion or sterile body fluid, such as CSF, typically requires prolonged incubation with a turnaround time of one to two weeks [6]. Sensitivity of culture also declines when lesions progress beyond the vesicular stage. SEROLOGIC TESTING — The presence of IgG antibodies to VZV correlates both with a history of varicella and protection against subsequent infection. Serologic testing has been employed in health care workers to assess susceptibility related to their potential risk of exposure. Serologic testing has also been employed in vaccine studies to assess response to immunization.",The real-time PCR assays show a significant increase in sensitivity compared to traditional culture methods for VZV detection.,The direct fluorescent antibody test is less effective than PCR in confirming VZV infection.,"Although viral culture has a certain yield in detecting VZV, its low sensitivity raises questions about its reliability in all cases."

Effective interventions include a number of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies that are often provided in combination. Patients with fibromyalgia generally respond best to a multidisciplinary, individualized treatment program that incorporates the primary treating clinician and other healthcare providers, including physical medicine, rehabilitation, and mental health specialists [1]. The treatment of fibromyalgia in adults who are not responsive to initial therapies will be reviewed here. The initial treatment and prognosis of fibromyalgia in adults; the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia; and fibromyalgia in children and adolescents are discussed separately. (See ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"" and ""Pathogenesis of fibromyalgia"" and ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults"" and ""Differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia"" and ""Fibromyalgia in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"".) OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT — Treatment of fibromyalgia is directed at reducing the major symptoms of this disorder, including chronic widespread pain, fatigue, insomnia, and cognitive dysfunction [2-4]. A variety of modalities are employed, using a stepwise approach . (See ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults"".) Initial therapy — Our initial approach to the treatment of patients with fibromyalgia is discussed in detail separately. (See ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"".) Briefly, the initial steps in therapy include:
● Patient education regarding the disease, the treatment approaches, good sleep hygiene, and the importance of treating comorbidities that may contribute to symptoms, including mood or sleep disorders (see ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Patient education')
● An exercise program, including aerobic conditioning, stretching, and strengthening (see ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Exercise')
● Drug monotherapy for treatment of symptoms not relieved by nonpharmacologic measures (see ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Medications') Patients not responsive to initial therapy — Many patients experience continued symptoms despite initial nonpharmacologic measures and treatment with a single drug at the maximum tolerated dose; we advise the continued use of several different treatment modalities in such patients, including both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment measures. The specific intervention depends upon symptoms, patient preferences regarding the types of therapies, available resources, and expertise. These interventions are not mutually exclusive and may include:
● Combinations of drugs (see 'Combination drug therapy' below)
● Referral for a supervised physical medicine and rehabilitation evaluation and treatment program (see 'Exercise and physical therapy' below)
● Referral for psychological interventions for pain management, including cognitive behavioral therapy and other interventions (see 'Psychological therapies' below)
● Consultation with one or more specialists, depending upon the specific expertise needed, such as a rheumatologist, physiatrist, psychiatrist, psychologist, sleep specialist, or pain management specialist (see 'Consultation and referral' below)
● Assessment and care in a specialized multidisciplinary program, particularly for patients with disease refractory to other interventions or on chronic opioids (see 'Multidisciplinary treatment programs' below)
● Other treatments, including medications for which there is more limited evidence, and complementary and alternative measures, including ""mind-body"" therapies such as tai chi and yoga (see 'Analgesic and antiinflammatory drugs' below and 'Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors' below and 'Complementary and alternative therapies' below) Nonpharmacologic interventions are important in the initial management of fibromyalgia; these and other nonpharmacologic interventions are also beneficial to patients with disease that does not respond to initial therapies.

(See ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Overview of treatment' and ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Prognosis'.) COMBINATION DRUG THERAPY — We suggest the use of combination drug therapy in most patients unresponsive to monotherapy, based upon the symptoms that most affect the patient. These recommendations are based largely upon clinical experience, as there is relatively little data regarding the relative benefits or adverse effects of drug combinations. The evidence for efficacy of each of the individual drugs is discussed separately. (See ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Medications'.)

A variety of combinations may be effective, and selection of specific agents depends upon patient tolerance, drug availability, cost to the patient, and comorbidities that may be present, such as psychiatric illness. Examples of combinations we have used are:
● There has been evidence for combining a low dose of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (eg, fluoxetine) or an SNRI in the morning with a low dose of tricyclic antidepressant (eg, amitriptyline) in the evening [5].

(See 'Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors' below and ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Tricyclic antidepressants as initial drug therapy'.)
● A low dose of a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) (eg, duloxetine or milnacipran) in the morning with a low dose of an anticonvulsant (eg, pregabalin) in the evening. This combination has thus far been evaluated in an open-label randomized trial involving 364 patients [6]. In this trial, fibromyalgia patients with an inadequate response to treatment with pregabalin (300 or 450 mg daily) experienced significantly greater pain reduction and global improvement with the addition of an SNRI, milnacipran (100 mg daily), compared with patients continuing pregabalin alone (see ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Duloxetine' and ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Pregabalin').

./UTD2txt/17772.txt,"● The combination of duloxetine and pregabalin were compared in a randomized trial with each as monotherapy [7]. The combination resulted in greater improvement in a number of clinical outcomes, including pain, function, and sleep. Another trial, involving 143 patients with fibromyalgia, compared the combination of the antiviral agent famciclovir with celecoxib with placebo, noting greater improvement in scores with the combination for pain, function, and fatigue [8]. In addition, the medication adherence for the combinations of pregabalin with either duloxetine, milnacipran, or venlafaxine was better than monotherapy with each of those four medications [9]. However, total health care costs were higher with the combination therapy. Clinicians with insufficient experience in the use of these medications or drug combinations may wish to consult with an expert in the pharmacologic treatment of fibromyalgia, such as a rheumatologist. In patients who also have a comorbid psychiatric illness, we advise consultation with a psychiatrist for assistance in medication management and coordination of care. (See 'Consultation and referral' below.) In patients without an adequate response to these medications or with a temporary need for additional treatment during an exacerbation of pain symptoms, other agents such as acetaminophen, tramadol, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are adjunctive or alternative therapies that may be helpful. Other antidepressants may also be used in some patients as alternative agents; however, there is less evidence for their benefit than the tricyclics, SNRIs, SSRIs, or anticonvulsants cited above. (See 'Analgesic and antiinflammatory drugs' below and 'Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors' below and 'Antiinflammatory medications' below.) Other medications that have been used in patients with fibromyalgia include opioid analgesics other than tramadol, muscle relaxants, and stimulants, but there is insufficient evidence for their efficacy or safety in the treatment of fibromyalgia. (See 'Other therapies' below and 'Analgesics' below.) EXERCISE AND PHYSICAL THERAPY — In patients who have had difficulty achieving a sufficient level of low-impact aerobic exercise, we encourage participation in a supervised physical exercise program. Evidence supporting the efficacy of exercise training is described separately. (See ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Efficacy of exercise'.) We refer patients with continued difficulties with exercise or physical functioning to a physiatrist and/or a physical therapist for further evaluation and for assistance in management and improvement in physical functioning. (See 'Consultation and referral' below.) Water-based therapies may be effective, and possibly comparable to land-based therapy [10,11]. In one trial, swimming improved pain and functional capacity comparably to a walking program [11]. In some countries, treatment with balneotherapy, such as immersion in thermal or mineral water (eg, spa treatment), is used for treating patients with fibromyalgia [12]. A 2017 meta-analysis found that exercise training improved anxiety in patients with fibromyalgia [13]. Resistance training was found to reduce pain and fatigue and to improve strength, leptin, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels in lean women with fibromyalgia but not in those who were overweight or obese [14]. Additional forms of exercise that have shown some benefit in fibromyalgia but which are not primarily directed at developing aerobic fitness include ""mind-body"" interventions such as tai chi and yoga. (See 'Tai chi' below and 'Yoga' below.) PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES — In patients whose symptoms do not respond adequately to initial therapies, we suggest referral through a multidisciplinary treatment program or to a behavioral specialist for psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); the specific interventions should be individualized based upon patient preference and available resources [15,16]. Psychological interventions should be integrated with multidisciplinary treatment that also includes pharmacologic therapy, education, and exercise. (See 'Consultation and referral' below and 'Multidisciplinary treatment programs' below.) A role for psychological therapies, particularly CBT, in the treatment of fibromyalgia is well-supported by evidence from meta-analyses, individual trials, and observational studies [17]. CBT is also established as a therapy for insomnia (see ""Treatment of insomnia in adults"", section on 'Cognitive behavioral therapy'). In addition to CBT, measures that are helpful include mindfulness-based treatments, relaxation, biofeedback, behavioral treatments, and educational interventions [18]. Additionally, education, focusing on self-management, combined with exercise enhances the benefits of exercise in fibromyalgia [19]. (See ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Effectiveness of patient education'.) The cost utility of CBT was shown in a six-month randomized trial in which CBT was more cost-effective than a combination of pregabalin and duloxetine or usual care [20]. A 2015 systematic review of 61 trials involving 4234 patients concluded that psychological interventions may be effective in improving physical functioning, pain, and low mood for adults with fibromyalgia in comparison with usual care controls, but the overall quality of the evidence was low [21]. An internet-delivered cognitive behavioral pain management course given to 30 fibromyalgia patients significantly improved symptoms compared with 30 waitlisted controls [22]. Pain, depression, and patient satisfaction improved during the five-lesson course delivered over eight weeks. A long-term economic evaluation of cognitive behavioral therapy for functional somatic syndromes, including fibromyalgia, found significant short- and long-term benefit [23]. There were 7184 euros cost savings during the third year after treatment. Cognitive behavioral therapy, compared with patient education, reduced catastrophizing in fibromyalgia patients [24]. This correlated with brain primary somatosensory cortex (S1)-insula, suggesting that cognitive behavioral therapy may normalize pain-related hyperreactivity in fibromyalgia. In patients with significant cognitive dysfunction despite other therapies, referral to an expert in cognitive impairment, such as a neurologist, may be of benefit to determine whether other causes for cognitive dysfunction are present and if further diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are required. Some patients may also benefit from consultation with a clinical psychologist for neuropsychological (psychometric) testing. (See ""Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia"" and ""Mild cognitive impairment: Epidemiology, pathology, and clinical assessment"" and ""Mild cognitive impairment: Epidemiology, pathology, and clinical assessment"", section on 'Neuropsychological testing'.) FACTORS LIMITING TREATMENT EFFICACY — Several factors may limit the degree of benefit achieved with prescribed medications or other interventions, including nonadherence to treatment interventions or comorbidities that cause peripheral pain and that require additional interventions to those used for treatment of the fibromyalgia. (See 'Nonadherence to treatment recommendations' below and 'Treating peripheral pain' below.) Nonadherence to treatment recommendations — A lack of adherence to the prescribed treatment program is common in fibromyalgia and should also be evaluated as a potential cause of persistent symptoms. Noncompliance, whether due to forgetfulness, due to carelessness, or as an exercise of patient autonomy, may contribute to a lack of effectiveness of medications prescribed for patients with fibromyalgia. Adherence to advice by patients with fibromyalgia cared for by 10 rheumatologists was assessed in a study of 127 women with fibromyalgia recruited from both tertiary care hospitals and the community [25]. Overall, 47 percent of the women reported noncompliance with medications. The degree of discordance between a clinician’s and patient’s assessments of communication during, as well as patient satisfaction at the conclusion of, a clinician-patient encounter was a significant determinant of overall compliance. A large study using insurance claims data from the United States found that only 31 percent of fibromyalgia patients initiated treatment with one of the medications listed in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines [26]. These medications included pregabalin, gabapentin, duloxetine, milnacipran, cyclobenzaprine, tramadol, amitriptyline, and venlafaxine. Many of these subjects did not receive the recommended dose, and adherence was suboptimal for each of the ACR recommended medications.","Combining duloxetine and pregabalin leads to significant improvements in clinical outcomes for fibromyalgia patients, such as pain and sleep.",The total health care costs associated with combination therapy are lower than those incurred with monotherapy.,"While psychological therapies like cognitive behavioral therapy are supported by evidence, the overall quality of that evidence remains low."

Clinicians with insufficient experience in the use of these medications or drug combinations may wish to consult with an expert in the pharmacologic treatment of fibromyalgia, such as a rheumatologist. In patients who also have a comorbid psychiatric illness, we advise consultation with a psychiatrist for assistance in medication management and coordination of care. (See 'Consultation and referral' below.) In patients without an adequate response to these medications or with a temporary need for additional treatment during an exacerbation of pain symptoms, other agents such as acetaminophen, tramadol, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are adjunctive or alternative therapies that may be helpful. Other antidepressants may also be used in some patients as alternative agents; however, there is less evidence for their benefit than the tricyclics, SNRIs, SSRIs, or anticonvulsants cited above. (See 'Analgesic and antiinflammatory drugs' below and 'Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors' below and 'Antiinflammatory medications' below.) Other medications that have been used in patients with fibromyalgia include opioid analgesics other than tramadol, muscle relaxants, and stimulants, but there is insufficient evidence for their efficacy or safety in the treatment of fibromyalgia. (See 'Other therapies' below and 'Analgesics' below.) EXERCISE AND PHYSICAL THERAPY — In patients who have had difficulty achieving a sufficient level of low-impact aerobic exercise, we encourage participation in a supervised physical exercise program. Evidence supporting the efficacy of exercise training is described separately. (See ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Efficacy of exercise'.) We refer patients with continued difficulties with exercise or physical functioning to a physiatrist and/or a physical therapist for further evaluation and for assistance in management and improvement in physical functioning. (See 'Consultation and referral' below.) Water-based therapies may be effective, and possibly comparable to land-based therapy [10,11]. In one trial, swimming improved pain and functional capacity comparably to a walking program [11]. In some countries, treatment with balneotherapy, such as immersion in thermal or mineral water (eg, spa treatment), is used for treating patients with fibromyalgia [12]. A 2017 meta-analysis found that exercise training improved anxiety in patients with fibromyalgia [13]. Resistance training was found to reduce pain and fatigue and to improve strength, leptin, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels in lean women with fibromyalgia but not in those who were overweight or obese [14]. Additional forms of exercise that have shown some benefit in fibromyalgia but which are not primarily directed at developing aerobic fitness include ""mind-body"" interventions such as tai chi and yoga. (See 'Tai chi' below and 'Yoga' below.) PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES — In patients whose symptoms do not respond adequately to initial therapies, we suggest referral through a multidisciplinary treatment program or to a behavioral specialist for psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); the specific interventions should be individualized based upon patient preference and available resources [15,16]. Psychological interventions should be integrated with multidisciplinary treatment that also includes pharmacologic therapy, education, and exercise. (See 'Consultation and referral' below and 'Multidisciplinary treatment programs' below.) A role for psychological therapies, particularly CBT, in the treatment of fibromyalgia is well-supported by evidence from meta-analyses, individual trials, and observational studies [17]. CBT is also established as a therapy for insomnia (see ""Treatment of insomnia in adults"", section on 'Cognitive behavioral therapy'). In addition to CBT, measures that are helpful include mindfulness-based treatments, relaxation, biofeedback, behavioral treatments, and educational interventions [18]. Additionally, education, focusing on self-management, combined with exercise enhances the benefits of exercise in fibromyalgia [19]. (See ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Effectiveness of patient education'.) The cost utility of CBT was shown in a six-month randomized trial in which CBT was more cost-effective than a combination of pregabalin and duloxetine or usual care [20]. A 2015 systematic review of 61 trials involving 4234 patients concluded that psychological interventions may be effective in improving physical functioning, pain, and low mood for adults with fibromyalgia in comparison with usual care controls, but the overall quality of the evidence was low [21]. An internet-delivered cognitive behavioral pain management course given to 30 fibromyalgia patients significantly improved symptoms compared with 30 waitlisted controls [22]. Pain, depression, and patient satisfaction improved during the five-lesson course delivered over eight weeks. A long-term economic evaluation of cognitive behavioral therapy for functional somatic syndromes, including fibromyalgia, found significant short- and long-term benefit [23]. There were 7184 euros cost savings during the third year after treatment. Cognitive behavioral therapy, compared with patient education, reduced catastrophizing in fibromyalgia patients [24]. This correlated with brain primary somatosensory cortex (S1)-insula, suggesting that cognitive behavioral therapy may normalize pain-related hyperreactivity in fibromyalgia. In patients with significant cognitive dysfunction despite other therapies, referral to an expert in cognitive impairment, such as a neurologist, may be of benefit to determine whether other causes for cognitive dysfunction are present and if further diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are required. Some patients may also benefit from consultation with a clinical psychologist for neuropsychological (psychometric) testing. (See ""Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia"" and ""Mild cognitive impairment: Epidemiology, pathology, and clinical assessment"" and ""Mild cognitive impairment: Epidemiology, pathology, and clinical assessment"", section on 'Neuropsychological testing'.) FACTORS LIMITING TREATMENT EFFICACY — Several factors may limit the degree of benefit achieved with prescribed medications or other interventions, including nonadherence to treatment interventions or comorbidities that cause peripheral pain and that require additional interventions to those used for treatment of the fibromyalgia. (See 'Nonadherence to treatment recommendations' below and 'Treating peripheral pain' below.) Nonadherence to treatment recommendations — A lack of adherence to the prescribed treatment program is common in fibromyalgia and should also be evaluated as a potential cause of persistent symptoms. Noncompliance, whether due to forgetfulness, due to carelessness, or as an exercise of patient autonomy, may contribute to a lack of effectiveness of medications prescribed for patients with fibromyalgia. Adherence to advice by patients with fibromyalgia cared for by 10 rheumatologists was assessed in a study of 127 women with fibromyalgia recruited from both tertiary care hospitals and the community [25]. Overall, 47 percent of the women reported noncompliance with medications. The degree of discordance between a clinician’s and patient’s assessments of communication during, as well as patient satisfaction at the conclusion of, a clinician-patient encounter was a significant determinant of overall compliance. A large study using insurance claims data from the United States found that only 31 percent of fibromyalgia patients initiated treatment with one of the medications listed in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines [26]. These medications included pregabalin, gabapentin, duloxetine, milnacipran, cyclobenzaprine, tramadol, amitriptyline, and venlafaxine. Many of these subjects did not receive the recommended dose, and adherence was suboptimal for each of the ACR recommended medications.",Exercise training has been shown to improve anxiety in patients suffering from fibromyalgia.,There is substantial evidence supporting the efficacy of opioid analgesics other than tramadol in treating fibromyalgia.,"Some patients may benefit from treatments like yoga and tai chi, but their effectiveness varies depending on individual responses to these therapies."

The combination resulted in greater improvement in a number of clinical outcomes, including pain, function, and sleep.

Nausea was more than twice as common among those on the active medication compared with those on placebo (9 versus 4 percent). While these findings are encouraging, the patients had received little treatment before enrollment, and prior uses of tricyclic antidepressants, of cyclobenzaprine, and of analgesics (including acetaminophen) were criteria for exclusion. It is uncertain how effective the combination of acetaminophen and tramadol would be for patients who had tried and failed other treatments or how the combination would perform if added to ongoing treatment with one or more of the CNS active medications. There is some concern regarding the long-term potential for abuse of tramadol, a weak opioid, although the risks and adverse effects may theoretically be less than those of more potent narcotic analgesics that have also been tried in fibromyalgia [41]. Prolonged use of such agents in fibromyalgia is controversial, and we prefer that a pain management specialist be involved in the care of those patients who are receiving strong opioids on a long-term basis [42]. (See ""Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain"", section on 'Opioids'.) There is no evidence that opioids are effective in the treatment of fibromyalgia, and a number of reports suggest that they adversely affect outcome [42]. A 2014 position paper of the American Academy of Neurology concluded that the risks from chronic opioid therapy for some chronic conditions, including fibromyalgia, are likely to outweigh the benefits of these medications [43]. Similarly, a 2015 systematic review of the effectiveness and risks of long-term opioid therapy for chronic pain found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of such therapy, but it did find evidence of a dose-dependent risk for a range of harms, such as overdose, opioid abuse, fractures, myocardial infarction, and sexual dysfunction [44]. Antiinflammatory medications — We do not use nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as the primary drug for pain in patients with fibromyalgia, and we do not use glucocorticoids in this condition. Several small randomized trials have failed to show that antiinflammatory medications are effective forms of treatment; therapeutic doses of naproxen, ibuprofen, and prednisone (15 mg/day) were each found to be no better than placebo in these trials, which generally also permitted the use of acetaminophen as needed [1-3,45]. A Cochrane database review concluded that there is only a modest amount of very low-quality evidence addressing the use of NSAIDs in fibromyalgia, which comes from small, largely inadequate studies with potential risk of bias [46]. Such bias would be expected to increase the apparent benefits of NSAIDs. One randomized trial study did find some benefit of etoricoxib compared with placebo in patients with fibromyalgia [47].

This topic will cover the issues related to monitoring of HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis (TB), including directly observed therapy, the clinical response to treatment, adverse events related to treatment, duration of treatment, and prognosis. Issues related to clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of susceptible TB in HIV-infected patients are discussed elsewhere.

INITIATION OF THERAPY — Issues related to selection of antituberculous therapy and antiretroviral therapy are discussed separately. (See ""Treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-infected adults: Initiation of therapy"".) DURATION OF THERAPY — The standard duration of therapy for treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary TB in HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is six months. This includes an intensive phase of four drugs (isoniazid, a rifamycin [eg, rifampin or rifabutin], pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) administered for two months, followed by a continuation phase of two drugs (isoniazid and a rifamycin) administered for four months [1,2]. All HIV-infected patients should be started on ART during treatment of tuberculosis. Issues related to timing of therapy are discussed separately. (See ""Treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-infected adults: Initiation of therapy"", section on 'Timing'.) In rare instances in which ART is not administered during antituberculous therapy (ie, if ART is not available or if there are unavoidable concerns regarding drug interactions), the continuation phase of antituberculous therapy should be extended for an additional three months (ie, a continuation phase of seven months, corresponding to a total of nine months of antituberculous therapy) [2]. Further study is needed to address the optimal duration of antituberculous therapy in HIV-infected patients. In a 2012 meta-analysis including 6 randomized trials and 21 cohort studies, relapse was more common among patients whose regimens included two months of rifamycin than among patients whose regimens included at least eight months of rifamycin (adjusted risk ratio 5.0, 95% CI 1.9-13.2). The risk of relapse was lower with rifampin treatment for ≥9 months compared with 6 months of rifampin (pooled risk difference -9.1 percent, 95% CI -16.5 to -1.8 percent) [3,4]. However, available antiretroviral therapy has improved substantially since this study was performed [2]. For those patients with cavitary disease and positive sputum cultures after two months of treatment, the duration of the continuation phase should be extended from four to seven months (total duration of treatment extended from six to nine months) [1,2]. No further adjustments in duration of therapy are warranted for patients who did not receive ART during antituberculous therapy (ie, total duration of antituberculous therapy nine months). Issues related to duration of therapy for HIV-infected patients with drug-resistant TB are discussed separately. (See ""Treatment of drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis in adults"".) CLINICAL MONITORING — HIV-infected patients with TB generally respond well to therapy if the diagnosis is made promptly and standard therapy instituted. Fever usually resolves within one month; improvement in chest radiograph findings may take longer. Sputum monitoring — During treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, sputum should be obtained for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture at monthly intervals until two consecutive cultures are negative [2]. Sputum AFB smear and culture at the end of the intensive phase (after two months of treatment) is particularly important for assessing relapse risk and for determining the duration of the continuation phase (algorithm 1). The approach in the setting of persistently positive sputum culture is discussed below. (See 'Persistently positive sputum culture' below.) After the sputum smear has converted to negative, at least one sputum should be collected at the completion of therapy to confirm that the patient has remained smear and culture negative [1]. Drug-related side effects — Antituberculous drugs are associated with a broad array of adverse effects, and the likelihood of adverse effects may be increased in HIV-infected patients [5].",Monitoring HIV-infected patients on antituberculous medications requires careful consideration of their treatment regimens and potential complications.,The standard duration of therapy for treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary TB in HIV-infected patients is not six months.,"While HIV-infected patients generally respond well to therapy, the effectiveness may vary based on the timing of diagnosis and treatment initiation."

./UTD2txt/11303.txt,"Treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-infected adults: Follow-up after initiation of therapy Author:Timothy R Sterling, MD Section Editor:C Fordham von Reyn, MD Deputy Editor:Elinor L Baron, MD, DTMHContributor INTRODUCTION — The approach to monitoring the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patient on antituberculous medications must include consideration of the antituberculous regimen, the antiretroviral therapy regimen, potential drug reactions, and complications related to the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). This topic will cover the issues related to monitoring of HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis (TB), including directly observed therapy, the clinical response to treatment, adverse events related to treatment, duration of treatment, and prognosis. Issues related to clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of susceptible TB in HIV-infected patients are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-infected adults: Initiation of therapy"" and ""Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in adults"".) INITIATION OF THERAPY — Issues related to selection of antituberculous therapy and antiretroviral therapy are discussed separately. (See ""Treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-infected adults: Initiation of therapy"".) DURATION OF THERAPY — The standard duration of therapy for treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary TB in HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) is six months. This includes an intensive phase of four drugs (isoniazid, a rifamycin [eg, rifampin or rifabutin], pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) administered for two months, followed by a continuation phase of two drugs (isoniazid and a rifamycin) administered for four months [1,2]. All HIV-infected patients should be started on ART during treatment of tuberculosis. Issues related to timing of therapy are discussed separately. (See ""Treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-infected adults: Initiation of therapy"", section on 'Timing'.) In rare instances in which ART is not administered during antituberculous therapy (ie, if ART is not available or if there are unavoidable concerns regarding drug interactions), the continuation phase of antituberculous therapy should be extended for an additional three months (ie, a continuation phase of seven months, corresponding to a total of nine months of antituberculous therapy) [2]. Further study is needed to address the optimal duration of antituberculous therapy in HIV-infected patients. In a 2012 meta-analysis including 6 randomized trials and 21 cohort studies, relapse was more common among patients whose regimens included two months of rifamycin than among patients whose regimens included at least eight months of rifamycin (adjusted risk ratio 5.0, 95% CI 1.9-13.2). The risk of relapse was lower with rifampin treatment for ≥9 months compared with 6 months of rifampin (pooled risk difference -9.1 percent, 95% CI -16.5 to -1.8 percent) [3,4]. However, available antiretroviral therapy has improved substantially since this study was performed [2]. For those patients with cavitary disease and positive sputum cultures after two months of treatment, the duration of the continuation phase should be extended from four to seven months (total duration of treatment extended from six to nine months) [1,2]. No further adjustments in duration of therapy are warranted for patients who did not receive ART during antituberculous therapy (ie, total duration of antituberculous therapy nine months). Issues related to duration of therapy for HIV-infected patients with drug-resistant TB are discussed separately. (See ""Treatment of drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis in adults"".) CLINICAL MONITORING — HIV-infected patients with TB generally respond well to therapy if the diagnosis is made promptly and standard therapy instituted. Fever usually resolves within one month; improvement in chest radiograph findings may take longer. Sputum monitoring — During treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, sputum should be obtained for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture at monthly intervals until two consecutive cultures are negative [2].

The approach in the setting of persistently positive sputum culture is discussed below. (See 'Persistently positive sputum culture' below.) After the sputum smear has converted to negative, at least one sputum should be collected at the completion of therapy to confirm that the patient has remained smear and culture negative [1]. Drug-related side effects — Antituberculous drugs are associated with a broad array of adverse effects, and the likelihood of adverse effects may be increased in HIV-infected patients [5].","In rare cases where ART is not administered, the continuation phase of antituberculous therapy should be extended for an additional three months.",All HIV-infected patients can safely be started on ART during treatment of tuberculosis without exceptions.,"Further studies are needed to determine the optimal duration of antituberculous therapy for HIV-infected patients, suggesting ongoing uncertainty in treatment guidelines."

Management of TB-IRIS does not differ substantially from management of IRIS associated with other conditions. (See ""Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome"", section on 'Tuberculosis'.) IRIS is usually self-limited and in general does not require alteration or interruption of the antituberculous or antiretroviral regimens. Administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or a short course of corticosteroids is warranted for IRIS causing significant symptoms [1].",Enlarging intracranial tuberculomas are one of the clinical manifestations of IRIS in HIV-infected patients with TB.,The administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is not recommended for patients experiencing IRIS symptoms.,"The effectiveness of a short course of corticosteroids for managing IRIS symptoms is debatable, as it might be beneficial in some cases but not in others."

● The approach to monitoring the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patient with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) on antituberculous medications must include consideration of the antituberculous regimen, the antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen, potential drug reactions, and complications related to the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). (See 'Introduction' above.)
● Issues related to selection of antituberculous therapy and antiretroviral therapy are discussed separately. (See ""Treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-infected adults: Initiation of therapy"".)
● The standard duration of therapy for treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary TB in HIV-infected patients on ART is six months. This includes an intensive phase of four drugs (isoniazid, a rifamycin [eg, rifampin or rifabutin], pyrazinamide, and ethambutol) administered for two months, followed by a continuation phase of two drugs (isoniazid and a rifamycin) administered for four months. (See 'Duration of therapy' above.)
● In rare instances in which ART is not administered during antituberculous therapy (ie, ART is not available or there are unavoidable concerns regarding drug interactions), the continuation phase should be extended for an additional three months (ie, a continuation phase of seven months), corresponding to a total of nine months of antituberculous therapy. (See 'Duration of therapy' above.)
● During treatment of pulmonary TB, sputum should be obtained for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture at monthly intervals until two consecutive cultures are negative. Sputum AFB smear and culture at the end of the intensive phase (after two months of treatment) is particularly important for assessing relapse risk and for determining the duration of the continuation phase (algorithm 1). (See 'Sputum monitoring' above.)
● Patient education regarding symptoms of hepatitis and other possible drug toxicities should be reinforced at each follow-up visit, at least monthly. Patients should be instructed to report signs or symptoms of toxicity immediately and stop antituberculous medications until advised to resume. (See 'Drug-related side effects' above.)

Uterine sarcomas arise from dividing cell populations in the myometrium or connective tissue elements within the endometrium. Compared with the more common endometrial carcinomas (epithelial neoplasms), uterine sarcomas, particularly leiomyosarcomas (connective tissue neoplasms), behave aggressively and are associated with a poorer prognosis. (See ""Endometrial carcinoma: Pretreatment evaluation, staging, and surgical treatment"".) The classification, clinical manifestations, and staging of uterine sarcomas that arise in adults (eg, endometrial stromal sarcomas, leiomyosarcoma, adenosarcoma) are reviewed here. Staging and treatment of endometrial stromal tumors and leiomyosarcoma are discussed separately. Carcinosarcoma, which is no longer classified as a sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma, which typically arises in children and adolescents, are also discussed separately. (See ""Treatment and prognosis of uterine leiomyosarcoma"" and ""Classification and treatment of endometrial stromal sarcoma and uterine adenosarcoma"" and ""Clinical features, diagnosis, staging, and treatment of uterine carcinosarcoma"" and ""Rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood and adolescence: Epidemiology, pathology, and molecular pathogenesis"".) CLASSIFICATION — The World Health Organization  and College of American Pathologists  have published classification systems for uterine sarcomas. The histologic classification of these neoplasms is based upon the differentiation/growth pattern of the neoplastic cells and their presumed cell of origin. Uterine sarcomas are referred to as homologous or heterologous. The majority are homologous (ie, differentiate in ways similar to normal uterine tissues), including endometrium (endometrial stromal sarcomas), muscle (leiomyosarcoma), or sarcomas of nonspecific supporting tissue (eg, connective tissue, blood vessels, lymphatics). By contrast, heterologous tumors contain elements with non-native differentiation (eg, skeletal muscle, cartilage, bone). Historically, uterine carcinosarcoma was classified as a type of uterine sarcoma and was termed malignant mixed müllerian tumor or mixed mesodermal sarcoma. However, these neoplasms are now classified as carcinomas since they derive from a monoclonal neoplastic cell, which has more characteristics of epithelial than stromal neoplasms. In addition, the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical behavior associated with carcinosarcoma suggest a closer relationship to endometrial carcinoma than to sarcoma. (See ""Clinical features, diagnosis, staging, and treatment of uterine carcinosarcoma"".) HISTOPATHOLOGYNonepithelial neoplasmsEndometrial stromal and related tumors — Endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESS) are uterine mesenchymal neoplasms with malignant potential. Historically, they were characterized as either low-grade or high-grade ESS. However, high-grade endometrial stromal tumors are now referred to as undifferentiated endometrial sarcomas (UES) or high-grade undifferentiated uterine sarcomas (HGUS), reflecting their composition of anaplastic cells with little or no evidence of endometrial stromal differentiation. The term endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) is primarily limited to neoplasms previously referred to as ""low grade."" Some observers believe there is a distinct entity of high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (distinct from undifferentiated uterine sarcoma); however, this is controversial. (See ""Classification and treatment of endometrial stromal sarcoma and uterine adenosarcoma"", section on 'Histopathology'.) Leiomyosarcoma — Leiomyosarcomas typically (though not always) have prominent cellular atypia, abundant mitoses (≥10 per 10 high power fields), and areas of coagulative necrosis (-B). Epithelial neoplasms have a clearly defined behavior (invasion) that indicates metastatic potential. Because smooth muscle neoplasms arise in the stroma (do not live in a compartment), they are more difficult to distinguish as benign (without metastatic potential) or malignant (with metastatic potential). Cellular atypia, mitosis, and ""coagulative necrosis"" are known as the Stanford criteria (originally described by the Stanford group). In the largest retrospective study, which resulted in the development of these criteria, the presence of two of the three features indicated a risk of metastatic spread of >10 percent  [3]. However, opinions vary as to the exact level of mitotic activity required for diagnosis of sarcoma [4]. Other common features, which are not diagnostic in isolation but may be used in borderline cases, are hypercellularity and infiltrative border [4]. Leiomyosarcomas typically are large (>10 cm) yellow or tan solitary masses with soft, fleshy cut surfaces with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis [5]. The mass may bulge into the uterine cavity, but the epicenter is in the myometrium. Leiomyosarcomas and leiomyomas are independent entities. Leiomyosarcomas are rare and while they may coexist in the same uterus with benign leiomyomas (fibroids), they exhibit differing cytogenetic abnormalities [6-8], and leiomyomas do not appear to be the precursor to leiomyosarcomas. Both neoplasms may express estrogen and progesterone receptors. Series of 20 or more leiomyosarcomas have reported estrogen receptors in 48 to 57 percent and progesterone receptors in 30 to 43 percent [9,10]. (See ""Differentiating uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) from uterine sarcomas"", section on 'Do leiomyomas progress to sarcoma?'.) There are two variant forms of leiomyosarcoma:
● Epithelioid leiomyosarcoma – Epithelioid leiomyosarcoma is characterized by round to polygonal cells with abundant eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm [11]. Epithelioid leiomyomas with atypia and ≥5 mitoses per 10 high power fields qualify as leiomyosarcoma. The absence of coagulative necrosis does not confirm benign behavior in these neoplasms. The clinical behavior is not well established for large (>6 cm) epithelioid smooth muscle neoplasms with moderate mitotic activity (two to four mitoses per 10 high power fields). Such neoplasms should be classified as epithelioid smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential (see below). ● Myxoid leiomyosarcomas – Myxoid leiomyosarcomas do not fit well into the Stanford scheme and are classified separately. The myxoid appearance may obscure the smooth muscle differentiation, the extent of nuclear pleomorphism, and the true number of mitotic figures. Although myxoid leiomyomas and smooth muscle neoplasms with prominent myxoid features must be thoroughly evaluated, particularly for mitosis because despite their apparently bland features, these neoplasms may behave in a highly malignant manner [12]. Benign histologic variants of leiomyomas and smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential are discussed separately. (See ""Variants of uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)"", section on 'Benign variants of leiomyomas' and ""Variants of uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)"", section on 'Smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential'.) Mixed endometrial stromal and smooth muscle tumor — These neoplasms, also referred to as stromomyomas, are defined as having at least 30 percent each of endometrial stromal and smooth muscle components [13]. There are few data regarding these lesions [13,14].","Uterine sarcomas account for a small percentage of all uterine malignant neoplasms, specifically between 3 to 9 percent.",Uterine sarcomas do not arise from dividing cell populations in the myometrium or connective tissue elements within the endometrium.,"While high-grade endometrial stromal tumors are now referred to as undifferentiated endometrial sarcomas, there is ongoing debate about whether high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma is a distinct entity."

Because smooth muscle neoplasms arise in the stroma (do not live in a compartment), they are more difficult to distinguish as benign (without metastatic potential) or malignant (with metastatic potential). Cellular atypia, mitosis, and ""coagulative necrosis"" are known as the Stanford criteria (originally described by the Stanford group). In the largest retrospective study, which resulted in the development of these criteria, the presence of two of the three features indicated a risk of metastatic spread of >10 percent  [3]. However, opinions vary as to the exact level of mitotic activity required for diagnosis of sarcoma [4]. Other common features, which are not diagnostic in isolation but may be used in borderline cases, are hypercellularity and infiltrative border [4]. Leiomyosarcomas typically are large (>10 cm) yellow or tan solitary masses with soft, fleshy cut surfaces with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis [5]. The mass may bulge into the uterine cavity, but the epicenter is in the myometrium. Leiomyosarcomas and leiomyomas are independent entities. Leiomyosarcomas are rare and while they may coexist in the same uterus with benign leiomyomas (fibroids), they exhibit differing cytogenetic abnormalities [6-8], and leiomyomas do not appear to be the precursor to leiomyosarcomas. Both neoplasms may express estrogen and progesterone receptors. Series of 20 or more leiomyosarcomas have reported estrogen receptors in 48 to 57 percent and progesterone receptors in 30 to 43 percent [9,10]. (See ""Differentiating uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) from uterine sarcomas"", section on 'Do leiomyomas progress to sarcoma?'.) There are two variant forms of leiomyosarcoma:
● Epithelioid leiomyosarcoma – Epithelioid leiomyosarcoma is characterized by round to polygonal cells with abundant eosinophilic or clear cytoplasm [11]. Epithelioid leiomyomas with atypia and ≥5 mitoses per 10 high power fields qualify as leiomyosarcoma. The absence of coagulative necrosis does not confirm benign behavior in these neoplasms. The clinical behavior is not well established for large (>6 cm) epithelioid smooth muscle neoplasms with moderate mitotic activity (two to four mitoses per 10 high power fields). Such neoplasms should be classified as epithelioid smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential (see below). ● Myxoid leiomyosarcomas – Myxoid leiomyosarcomas do not fit well into the Stanford scheme and are classified separately. The myxoid appearance may obscure the smooth muscle differentiation, the extent of nuclear pleomorphism, and the true number of mitotic figures. Although myxoid leiomyomas and smooth muscle neoplasms with prominent myxoid features must be thoroughly evaluated, particularly for mitosis because despite their apparently bland features, these neoplasms may behave in a highly malignant manner [12]. Benign histologic variants of leiomyomas and smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential are discussed separately. (See ""Variants of uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)"", section on 'Benign variants of leiomyomas' and ""Variants of uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)"", section on 'Smooth muscle tumors of uncertain malignant potential'.) Mixed endometrial stromal and smooth muscle tumor — These neoplasms, also referred to as stromomyomas, are defined as having at least 30 percent each of endometrial stromal and smooth muscle components [13]. There are few data regarding these lesions [13,14].",The classification systems for uterine sarcomas rely on the differentiation and growth patterns of the neoplastic cells.,"Heterologous tumors are characterized by elements that show native differentiation, contrary to the classification of uterine sarcomas.","The classification of carcinosarcoma has changed over time, leading to some confusion regarding its relationship with uterine sarcomas and endometrial carcinoma."

Uterine sarcomas arise from dividing cell populations in the myometrium or connective tissue elements within the endometrium. Compared with the more common endometrial carcinomas (epithelial neoplasms), uterine sarcomas, particularly leiomyosarcomas (connective tissue neoplasms), behave aggressively and are associated with a poorer prognosis. (See ""Endometrial carcinoma: Pretreatment evaluation, staging, and surgical treatment"".) The classification, clinical manifestations, and staging of uterine sarcomas that arise in adults (eg, endometrial stromal sarcomas, leiomyosarcoma, adenosarcoma) are reviewed here. Staging and treatment of endometrial stromal tumors and leiomyosarcoma are discussed separately. Carcinosarcoma, which is no longer classified as a sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma, which typically arises in children and adolescents, are also discussed separately. (See ""Treatment and prognosis of uterine leiomyosarcoma"" and ""Classification and treatment of endometrial stromal sarcoma and uterine adenosarcoma"" and ""Clinical features, diagnosis, staging, and treatment of uterine carcinosarcoma"" and ""Rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood and adolescence: Epidemiology, pathology, and molecular pathogenesis"".) CLASSIFICATION — The World Health Organization  and College of American Pathologists  have published classification systems for uterine sarcomas. The histologic classification of these neoplasms is based upon the differentiation/growth pattern of the neoplastic cells and their presumed cell of origin. Uterine sarcomas are referred to as homologous or heterologous. The majority are homologous (ie, differentiate in ways similar to normal uterine tissues), including endometrium (endometrial stromal sarcomas), muscle (leiomyosarcoma), or sarcomas of nonspecific supporting tissue (eg, connective tissue, blood vessels, lymphatics). By contrast, heterologous tumors contain elements with non-native differentiation (eg, skeletal muscle, cartilage, bone). Historically, uterine carcinosarcoma was classified as a type of uterine sarcoma and was termed malignant mixed müllerian tumor or mixed mesodermal sarcoma. However, these neoplasms are now classified as carcinomas since they derive from a monoclonal neoplastic cell, which has more characteristics of epithelial than stromal neoplasms. In addition, the epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical behavior associated with carcinosarcoma suggest a closer relationship to endometrial carcinoma than to sarcoma. (See ""Clinical features, diagnosis, staging, and treatment of uterine carcinosarcoma"".) HISTOPATHOLOGYNonepithelial neoplasmsEndometrial stromal and related tumors — Endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESS) are uterine mesenchymal neoplasms with malignant potential. Historically, they were characterized as either low-grade or high-grade ESS. However, high-grade endometrial stromal tumors are now referred to as undifferentiated endometrial sarcomas (UES) or high-grade undifferentiated uterine sarcomas (HGUS), reflecting their composition of anaplastic cells with little or no evidence of endometrial stromal differentiation. The term endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) is primarily limited to neoplasms previously referred to as ""low grade."" Some observers believe there is a distinct entity of high-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (distinct from undifferentiated uterine sarcoma); however, this is controversial. (See ""Classification and treatment of endometrial stromal sarcoma and uterine adenosarcoma"", section on 'Histopathology'.) Leiomyosarcoma — Leiomyosarcomas typically (though not always) have prominent cellular atypia, abundant mitoses (≥10 per 10 high power fields), and areas of coagulative necrosis (-B).

The rate of sarcoma appears to be increasing; from 1988 to 2001, the incidence of sarcoma rose from 7.6 to 9.1 percent of all uterine cancers [19]. Uterine sarcomas are aggressive, but many present at an early stage. In one series of over 1000 cases, the stage distribution was: stage I (60 percent), stage II and III (16 percent), and IV (22 percent)  [1]. RISK FACTORS — The rarity of uterine sarcoma has made it difficult to perform large studies to identify risk factors. Increasing age — The mean age at diagnosis is approximately 60 years old. However, uterine sarcomas have been diagnosed in women as young as 20 years old [20]. Race — Black women have an approximately twofold higher incidence of leiomyosarcomas (but not other types of uterine sarcoma) than white women [18,21]. Another study found that decreased survival for black women with uterine sarcoma was accounted for by decreased use of appropriate radiation therapy, and survival was comparable for subjects receiving similar therapy [18]. Tamoxifen — Long-term use of tamoxifen (five years or more) appears to be associated with an increase in risk of developing uterine sarcoma [22-24]. The absolute risk remains small; breast cancer prevention randomized trials have found a risk of 17 per 100,000 woman-years of uterine sarcoma in women taking tamoxifen [25]. There is no known relationship between tamoxifen-associated endometrial polyps and uterine sarcoma. (See ""Endometrial polyps"", section on 'Tamoxifen'.) Multiple histologic subtypes of sarcomas have been reported following tamoxifen treatment, but generally, sarcomas present two to five years following the start of therapy and are often at an advanced stage at presentation [11,24]. (See ""Managing the side effects of tamoxifen"".) The risk of uterine sarcoma is included in a US Food and Drug Administration black box warning regarding tamoxifen [26].

Other risk factors — Data regarding parity and time of menarche and menopause as risk factors are inconclusive [33]. CLINICAL PRESENTATION — Uterine sarcoma typically presents with abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain/pressure, and/or a uterine mass. In a one of the largest series with data from a national registry in Norway, the distribution of presenting symptoms was [1]:  
● Postmenopausal bleeding (31 to 46 percent)
● Premenopausal abnormal uterine bleeding (27 to 34 percent)
● Abdominal pain (4 to 13 percent)
● Abdominal distension (8 to 17 percent)
● Urinary symptoms (1 to 2 percent)
● Asymptomatic (1 to 2 percent) Although it is common clinical teaching to suspect a sarcoma in women with a ""rapidly growing"" uterus or leiomyoma (ie, doubling in size over a period of three to six months), the data do not support an increased risk of malignant neoplasm in such patients. In addition, although data are limited, large uterine size (in excess of 20 gestational weeks) has also not been shown to be associated with increased sarcoma risk. (See ""Differentiating uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) from uterine sarcomas"", section on 'Rapidly growing uterine mass' and ""Differentiating uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) from uterine sarcomas"", section on 'Large or solitary uterine mass'.) Some studies have reported bleeding accompanied by a foul smelling vaginal discharge as part of the clinical presentation [34,35]. Constipation has also been reported, likely due to pelvic pressure. The symptoms and findings on examination and imaging for uterine sarcoma are nearly identical to those for benign uterine leiomyomas, as well as for atypical leiomyoma variants. (See ""Differentiating uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) from uterine sarcomas"", section on 'Signs and symptoms'.) The diagnosis of a uterine sarcoma should be considered in postmenopausal women with presumed uterine leiomyomas who are producing symptoms sufficiently bothersome to consider hysterectomy; in this group, the incidence of sarcoma is approximately 0.2 percent [36-45].

Diagnosis frequently requires examination of multiple sites in the mass [56]. Features of the gross appearance of the mass, including the color, consistency, and variegation of the incised surface, can help guide sampling of tissue for microscopic examination. The three most important histologic criteria for the diagnosis of uterine sarcomas are: mitotic index, cellular atypia, and geographic areas of coagulative necrosis separated from viable neoplasm [3,57]; cellularity and type (eg, myxoid or epithelioid) are also utilized. The more features exhibited by the lesion, the more likely it is to have clinically aggressive behavior [3,57]. (See 'Histopathology' above.) DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS — Uterine sarcoma may present with abnormal uterine bleeding, pelvic pain/pressure, and/or a uterine mass. This presentation is identical to uterine leiomyomas or leiomyoma variants.",The histologic examination is crucial for the accurate diagnosis of uterine sarcomas.,Uterine sarcoma never presents with symptoms that overlap with those of uterine leiomyomas.,"The presence of cellular atypia is an important criterion for diagnosis, but its implications on clinical behavior can vary."

./UTD2txt/5235.txt,"However, the use of diagnostic assays may be important in specific situations, as discussed below. The clinical manifestations of chickenpox and shingles are discussed elsewhere. (See ""Treatment of herpes zoster in the immunocompetent host"" and ""Clinical features of varicella-zoster virus infection: Chickenpox"" and ""Clinical manifestations of varicella-zoster virus infection: Herpes zoster"".) GENERAL BACKGROUND — The diagnosis of VZV infection is usually a clinical diagnosis based on the characteristic vesicular lesions, which are seen widespread in chickenpox (varicella) or in a restricted dermatomal pattern with associated neuritis in shingles (herpes zoster). However, additional diagnostic information may be useful in the following situations:
● Atypical rash in an immunocompromised host
● Possible disseminated disease in an immunosuppressed host without cutaneous lesionsIn addition, serologic testing may be necessary to determine if an individual at increased risk for varicella requires immunization (eg, a healthcare worker born after 1980 who does not have a history of childhood infection). POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION — The real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays provide uniformly rapid and sensitive confirmation of VZV from clinical specimens obtained from skin lesions and selected body fluids such as CSF and bronchoalveolar lavage [1,2]. In a study comparing viral culture isolation to real-time PCR [2], 110 clinical specimens from dermal lesions were analyzed using both methods. VZV was isolated by culture in 15 samples (14 percent) and VZV DNA was detected by PCR in 51 (46 percent) samples. In another study of patients with a high clinical suspicion of herpes zoster, real-time PCR testing was highly sensitive compared with culture (92 versus 53 percent) [3]. In addition, PCR-based testing was highly specific; no cross-reactivity was identified when tested against several other viruses. Real-time PCR allows for rapid viral amplification, limits risk of contamination, confers superior sensitivity in isolating VZV from an array of clinical specimens, and affords more rapid turnaround time compared with conventional culture techniques. PCR testing is also useful for a variety of other indications, such as making a diagnosis in a patient with vaccine-modified infection [4]. PCR testing of serum or blood may also be helpful in the transplant patient who has visceral disease prior to the appearance of cutaneous lesions [5]. DIRECT FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY — Rapid diagnosis of VZV infection can usually be accomplished by using DFA on scrapings from active vesicular skin lesions that have not yet crusted. The DFA test is widely available; it has lower cost compared to culture, and is associated with more rapid turnaround time [6,7]. As noted with culture techniques above, one DFA assay can simultaneously detect HSV and VZV with a 1.5 hour turnaround time [6]. VIRAL CULTURE — Virus isolation by culture is sometimes available but is insensitive and associated with low yield (approximately 60 to 75 percent) when compared with PCR testing [8]. Specific VZV culture isolation from a swab of vesicular skin lesion or sterile body fluid, such as CSF, typically requires prolonged incubation with a turnaround time of one to two weeks [6]. Sensitivity of culture also declines when lesions progress beyond the vesicular stage. SEROLOGIC TESTING — The presence of IgG antibodies to VZV correlates both with a history of varicella and protection against subsequent infection.

(See ""Treatment of herpes zoster in the immunocompetent host"" and ""Clinical features of varicella-zoster virus infection: Chickenpox"" and ""Clinical manifestations of varicella-zoster virus infection: Herpes zoster"".) GENERAL BACKGROUND — The diagnosis of VZV infection is usually a clinical diagnosis based on the characteristic vesicular lesions, which are seen widespread in chickenpox (varicella) or in a restricted dermatomal pattern with associated neuritis in shingles (herpes zoster). However, additional diagnostic information may be useful in the following situations:
● Atypical rash in an immunocompromised host
● Possible disseminated disease in an immunosuppressed host without cutaneous lesionsIn addition, serologic testing may be necessary to determine if an individual at increased risk for varicella requires immunization (eg, a healthcare worker born after 1980 who does not have a history of childhood infection). POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION — The real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays provide uniformly rapid and sensitive confirmation of VZV from clinical specimens obtained from skin lesions and selected body fluids such as CSF and bronchoalveolar lavage [1,2]. In a study comparing viral culture isolation to real-time PCR [2], 110 clinical specimens from dermal lesions were analyzed using both methods. VZV was isolated by culture in 15 samples (14 percent) and VZV DNA was detected by PCR in 51 (46 percent) samples. In another study of patients with a high clinical suspicion of herpes zoster, real-time PCR testing was highly sensitive compared with culture (92 versus 53 percent) [3]. In addition, PCR-based testing was highly specific; no cross-reactivity was identified when tested against several other viruses. Real-time PCR allows for rapid viral amplification, limits risk of contamination, confers superior sensitivity in isolating VZV from an array of clinical specimens, and affords more rapid turnaround time compared with conventional culture techniques. PCR testing is also useful for a variety of other indications, such as making a diagnosis in a patient with vaccine-modified infection [4]. PCR testing of serum or blood may also be helpful in the transplant patient who has visceral disease prior to the appearance of cutaneous lesions [5]. DIRECT FLUORESCENT ANTIBODY — Rapid diagnosis of VZV infection can usually be accomplished by using DFA on scrapings from active vesicular skin lesions that have not yet crusted. The DFA test is widely available; it has lower cost compared to culture, and is associated with more rapid turnaround time [6,7]. As noted with culture techniques above, one DFA assay can simultaneously detect HSV and VZV with a 1.5 hour turnaround time [6].

The initial treatment and prognosis of fibromyalgia in adults; the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia; and fibromyalgia in children and adolescents are discussed separately. (See ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"" and ""Pathogenesis of fibromyalgia"" and ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults"" and ""Differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia"" and ""Fibromyalgia in children and adolescents: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis"".) OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT — Treatment of fibromyalgia is directed at reducing the major symptoms of this disorder, including chronic widespread pain, fatigue, insomnia, and cognitive dysfunction [2-4]. A variety of modalities are employed, using a stepwise approach . (See ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults"".) Initial therapy — Our initial approach to the treatment of patients with fibromyalgia is discussed in detail separately. (See ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"".) Briefly, the initial steps in therapy include:
● Patient education regarding the disease, the treatment approaches, good sleep hygiene, and the importance of treating comorbidities that may contribute to symptoms, including mood or sleep disorders (see ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Patient education')
● An exercise program, including aerobic conditioning, stretching, and strengthening (see ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Exercise')
● Drug monotherapy for treatment of symptoms not relieved by nonpharmacologic measures (see ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Medications') Patients not responsive to initial therapy — Many patients experience continued symptoms despite initial nonpharmacologic measures and treatment with a single drug at the maximum tolerated dose; we advise the continued use of several different treatment modalities in such patients, including both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment measures. The specific intervention depends upon symptoms, patient preferences regarding the types of therapies, available resources, and expertise. These interventions are not mutually exclusive and may include:
● Combinations of drugs (see 'Combination drug therapy' below)
● Referral for a supervised physical medicine and rehabilitation evaluation and treatment program (see 'Exercise and physical therapy' below)
● Referral for psychological interventions for pain management, including cognitive behavioral therapy and other interventions (see 'Psychological therapies' below)
● Consultation with one or more specialists, depending upon the specific expertise needed, such as a rheumatologist, physiatrist, psychiatrist, psychologist, sleep specialist, or pain management specialist (see 'Consultation and referral' below)
● Assessment and care in a specialized multidisciplinary program, particularly for patients with disease refractory to other interventions or on chronic opioids (see 'Multidisciplinary treatment programs' below)
● Other treatments, including medications for which there is more limited evidence, and complementary and alternative measures, including ""mind-body"" therapies such as tai chi and yoga (see 'Analgesic and antiinflammatory drugs' below and 'Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors' below and 'Complementary and alternative therapies' below) Nonpharmacologic interventions are important in the initial management of fibromyalgia; these and other nonpharmacologic interventions are also beneficial to patients with disease that does not respond to initial therapies.

(See ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Overview of treatment' and ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Prognosis'.) COMBINATION DRUG THERAPY — We suggest the use of combination drug therapy in most patients unresponsive to monotherapy, based upon the symptoms that most affect the patient. These recommendations are based largely upon clinical experience, as there is relatively little data regarding the relative benefits or adverse effects of drug combinations. The evidence for efficacy of each of the individual drugs is discussed separately. (See ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Medications'.) In clinical practice, we combine drugs of different classes to take advantage of multiple mechanisms of action for reducing pain and to target different symptoms. A variety of combinations may be effective, and selection of specific agents depends upon patient tolerance, drug availability, cost to the patient, and comorbidities that may be present, such as psychiatric illness. Examples of combinations we have used are:
● There has been evidence for combining a low dose of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (eg, fluoxetine) or an SNRI in the morning with a low dose of tricyclic antidepressant (eg, amitriptyline) in the evening [5]. In that trial, there was significantly greater improvement in pain with the combination of agents compared with fluoxetine or amitriptyline alone or with placebo (visual analogue pain scale score, with maximum of 100, of 43 versus 58 and of 64 versus 82). (See 'Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors' below and ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Tricyclic antidepressants as initial drug therapy'.)
● A low dose of a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) (eg, duloxetine or milnacipran) in the morning with a low dose of an anticonvulsant (eg, pregabalin) in the evening. This combination has thus far been evaluated in an open-label randomized trial involving 364 patients [6]. In this trial, fibromyalgia patients with an inadequate response to treatment with pregabalin (300 or 450 mg daily) experienced significantly greater pain reduction and global improvement with the addition of an SNRI, milnacipran (100 mg daily), compared with patients continuing pregabalin alone (see ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Duloxetine' and ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Pregabalin').

./UTD2txt/17772.txt,"● The combination of duloxetine and pregabalin were compared in a randomized trial with each as monotherapy [7]. The combination resulted in greater improvement in a number of clinical outcomes, including pain, function, and sleep. Another trial, involving 143 patients with fibromyalgia, compared the combination of the antiviral agent famciclovir with celecoxib with placebo, noting greater improvement in scores with the combination for pain, function, and fatigue [8]. In addition, the medication adherence for the combinations of pregabalin with either duloxetine, milnacipran, or venlafaxine was better than monotherapy with each of those four medications [9]. However, total health care costs were higher with the combination therapy. Clinicians with insufficient experience in the use of these medications or drug combinations may wish to consult with an expert in the pharmacologic treatment of fibromyalgia, such as a rheumatologist. In patients who also have a comorbid psychiatric illness, we advise consultation with a psychiatrist for assistance in medication management and coordination of care. (See 'Consultation and referral' below.) In patients without an adequate response to these medications or with a temporary need for additional treatment during an exacerbation of pain symptoms, other agents such as acetaminophen, tramadol, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are adjunctive or alternative therapies that may be helpful. Other antidepressants may also be used in some patients as alternative agents; however, there is less evidence for their benefit than the tricyclics, SNRIs, SSRIs, or anticonvulsants cited above. (See 'Analgesic and antiinflammatory drugs' below and 'Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors' below and 'Antiinflammatory medications' below.) Other medications that have been used in patients with fibromyalgia include opioid analgesics other than tramadol, muscle relaxants, and stimulants, but there is insufficient evidence for their efficacy or safety in the treatment of fibromyalgia. (See 'Other therapies' below and 'Analgesics' below.) EXERCISE AND PHYSICAL THERAPY — In patients who have had difficulty achieving a sufficient level of low-impact aerobic exercise, we encourage participation in a supervised physical exercise program. Evidence supporting the efficacy of exercise training is described separately. (See ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Efficacy of exercise'.) We refer patients with continued difficulties with exercise or physical functioning to a physiatrist and/or a physical therapist for further evaluation and for assistance in management and improvement in physical functioning. (See 'Consultation and referral' below.) Water-based therapies may be effective, and possibly comparable to land-based therapy [10,11]. In one trial, swimming improved pain and functional capacity comparably to a walking program [11]. In some countries, treatment with balneotherapy, such as immersion in thermal or mineral water (eg, spa treatment), is used for treating patients with fibromyalgia [12]. A 2017 meta-analysis found that exercise training improved anxiety in patients with fibromyalgia [13]. Resistance training was found to reduce pain and fatigue and to improve strength, leptin, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels in lean women with fibromyalgia but not in those who were overweight or obese [14]. Additional forms of exercise that have shown some benefit in fibromyalgia but which are not primarily directed at developing aerobic fitness include ""mind-body"" interventions such as tai chi and yoga. (See 'Tai chi' below and 'Yoga' below.) PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES — In patients whose symptoms do not respond adequately to initial therapies, we suggest referral through a multidisciplinary treatment program or to a behavioral specialist for psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); the specific interventions should be individualized based upon patient preference and available resources [15,16]. Psychological interventions should be integrated with multidisciplinary treatment that also includes pharmacologic therapy, education, and exercise. (See 'Consultation and referral' below and 'Multidisciplinary treatment programs' below.) A role for psychological therapies, particularly CBT, in the treatment of fibromyalgia is well-supported by evidence from meta-analyses, individual trials, and observational studies [17]. CBT is also established as a therapy for insomnia (see ""Treatment of insomnia in adults"", section on 'Cognitive behavioral therapy'). In addition to CBT, measures that are helpful include mindfulness-based treatments, relaxation, biofeedback, behavioral treatments, and educational interventions [18]. Additionally, education, focusing on self-management, combined with exercise enhances the benefits of exercise in fibromyalgia [19]. (See ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Effectiveness of patient education'.) The cost utility of CBT was shown in a six-month randomized trial in which CBT was more cost-effective than a combination of pregabalin and duloxetine or usual care [20]. A 2015 systematic review of 61 trials involving 4234 patients concluded that psychological interventions may be effective in improving physical functioning, pain, and low mood for adults with fibromyalgia in comparison with usual care controls, but the overall quality of the evidence was low [21]. An internet-delivered cognitive behavioral pain management course given to 30 fibromyalgia patients significantly improved symptoms compared with 30 waitlisted controls [22]. Pain, depression, and patient satisfaction improved during the five-lesson course delivered over eight weeks. A long-term economic evaluation of cognitive behavioral therapy for functional somatic syndromes, including fibromyalgia, found significant short- and long-term benefit [23]. There were 7184 euros cost savings during the third year after treatment. Cognitive behavioral therapy, compared with patient education, reduced catastrophizing in fibromyalgia patients [24]. This correlated with brain primary somatosensory cortex (S1)-insula, suggesting that cognitive behavioral therapy may normalize pain-related hyperreactivity in fibromyalgia. In patients with significant cognitive dysfunction despite other therapies, referral to an expert in cognitive impairment, such as a neurologist, may be of benefit to determine whether other causes for cognitive dysfunction are present and if further diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are required. Some patients may also benefit from consultation with a clinical psychologist for neuropsychological (psychometric) testing. (See ""Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia"" and ""Mild cognitive impairment: Epidemiology, pathology, and clinical assessment"" and ""Mild cognitive impairment: Epidemiology, pathology, and clinical assessment"", section on 'Neuropsychological testing'.) FACTORS LIMITING TREATMENT EFFICACY — Several factors may limit the degree of benefit achieved with prescribed medications or other interventions, including nonadherence to treatment interventions or comorbidities that cause peripheral pain and that require additional interventions to those used for treatment of the fibromyalgia. (See 'Nonadherence to treatment recommendations' below and 'Treating peripheral pain' below.) Nonadherence to treatment recommendations — A lack of adherence to the prescribed treatment program is common in fibromyalgia and should also be evaluated as a potential cause of persistent symptoms. Noncompliance, whether due to forgetfulness, due to carelessness, or as an exercise of patient autonomy, may contribute to a lack of effectiveness of medications prescribed for patients with fibromyalgia. Adherence to advice by patients with fibromyalgia cared for by 10 rheumatologists was assessed in a study of 127 women with fibromyalgia recruited from both tertiary care hospitals and the community [25]. Overall, 47 percent of the women reported noncompliance with medications. The degree of discordance between a clinician’s and patient’s assessments of communication during, as well as patient satisfaction at the conclusion of, a clinician-patient encounter was a significant determinant of overall compliance. A large study using insurance claims data from the United States found that only 31 percent of fibromyalgia patients initiated treatment with one of the medications listed in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines [26]. These medications included pregabalin, gabapentin, duloxetine, milnacipran, cyclobenzaprine, tramadol, amitriptyline, and venlafaxine. Many of these subjects did not receive the recommended dose, and adherence was suboptimal for each of the ACR recommended medications.","The combination of duloxetine and pregabalin was found to improve clinical outcomes such as pain, function, and sleep more effectively than when each was used alone.",The total healthcare costs associated with combination therapy were reported to be lower than those for monotherapy.,"While some patients may experience improved symptoms with psychological interventions, the overall quality of evidence supporting their effectiveness remains low."
./UTD2txt/17772.txt,"● The combination of duloxetine and pregabalin were compared in a randomized trial with each as monotherapy [7]. The combination resulted in greater improvement in a number of clinical outcomes, including pain, function, and sleep. Another trial, involving 143 patients with fibromyalgia, compared the combination of the antiviral agent famciclovir with celecoxib with placebo, noting greater improvement in scores with the combination for pain, function, and fatigue [8]. In addition, the medication adherence for the combinations of pregabalin with either duloxetine, milnacipran, or venlafaxine was better than monotherapy with each of those four medications [9]. However, total health care costs were higher with the combination therapy. Clinicians with insufficient experience in the use of these medications or drug combinations may wish to consult with an expert in the pharmacologic treatment of fibromyalgia, such as a rheumatologist. In patients who also have a comorbid psychiatric illness, we advise consultation with a psychiatrist for assistance in medication management and coordination of care. (See 'Consultation and referral' below.) In patients without an adequate response to these medications or with a temporary need for additional treatment during an exacerbation of pain symptoms, other agents such as acetaminophen, tramadol, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are adjunctive or alternative therapies that may be helpful. Other antidepressants may also be used in some patients as alternative agents; however, there is less evidence for their benefit than the tricyclics, SNRIs, SSRIs, or anticonvulsants cited above. (See 'Analgesic and antiinflammatory drugs' below and 'Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors' below and 'Antiinflammatory medications' below.) Other medications that have been used in patients with fibromyalgia include opioid analgesics other than tramadol, muscle relaxants, and stimulants, but there is insufficient evidence for their efficacy or safety in the treatment of fibromyalgia. (See 'Other therapies' below and 'Analgesics' below.) EXERCISE AND PHYSICAL THERAPY — In patients who have had difficulty achieving a sufficient level of low-impact aerobic exercise, we encourage participation in a supervised physical exercise program. Evidence supporting the efficacy of exercise training is described separately. (See ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Efficacy of exercise'.) We refer patients with continued difficulties with exercise or physical functioning to a physiatrist and/or a physical therapist for further evaluation and for assistance in management and improvement in physical functioning. (See 'Consultation and referral' below.) Water-based therapies may be effective, and possibly comparable to land-based therapy [10,11]. In one trial, swimming improved pain and functional capacity comparably to a walking program [11]. In some countries, treatment with balneotherapy, such as immersion in thermal or mineral water (eg, spa treatment), is used for treating patients with fibromyalgia [12]. A 2017 meta-analysis found that exercise training improved anxiety in patients with fibromyalgia [13]. Resistance training was found to reduce pain and fatigue and to improve strength, leptin, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels in lean women with fibromyalgia but not in those who were overweight or obese [14]. Additional forms of exercise that have shown some benefit in fibromyalgia but which are not primarily directed at developing aerobic fitness include ""mind-body"" interventions such as tai chi and yoga. (See 'Tai chi' below and 'Yoga' below.) PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES — In patients whose symptoms do not respond adequately to initial therapies, we suggest referral through a multidisciplinary treatment program or to a behavioral specialist for psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); the specific interventions should be individualized based upon patient preference and available resources [15,16]. Psychological interventions should be integrated with multidisciplinary treatment that also includes pharmacologic therapy, education, and exercise. (See 'Consultation and referral' below and 'Multidisciplinary treatment programs' below.) A role for psychological therapies, particularly CBT, in the treatment of fibromyalgia is well-supported by evidence from meta-analyses, individual trials, and observational studies [17]. CBT is also established as a therapy for insomnia (see ""Treatment of insomnia in adults"", section on 'Cognitive behavioral therapy'). In addition to CBT, measures that are helpful include mindfulness-based treatments, relaxation, biofeedback, behavioral treatments, and educational interventions [18]. Additionally, education, focusing on self-management, combined with exercise enhances the benefits of exercise in fibromyalgia [19]. (See ""Initial treatment of fibromyalgia in adults"", section on 'Effectiveness of patient education'.) The cost utility of CBT was shown in a six-month randomized trial in which CBT was more cost-effective than a combination of pregabalin and duloxetine or usual care [20]. A 2015 systematic review of 61 trials involving 4234 patients concluded that psychological interventions may be effective in improving physical functioning, pain, and low mood for adults with fibromyalgia in comparison with usual care controls, but the overall quality of the evidence was low [21]. An internet-delivered cognitive behavioral pain management course given to 30 fibromyalgia patients significantly improved symptoms compared with 30 waitlisted controls [22]. Pain, depression, and patient satisfaction improved during the five-lesson course delivered over eight weeks. A long-term economic evaluation of cognitive behavioral therapy for functional somatic syndromes, including fibromyalgia, found significant short- and long-term benefit [23]. There were 7184 euros cost savings during the third year after treatment. Cognitive behavioral therapy, compared with patient education, reduced catastrophizing in fibromyalgia patients [24]. This correlated with brain primary somatosensory cortex (S1)-insula, suggesting that cognitive behavioral therapy may normalize pain-related hyperreactivity in fibromyalgia. In patients with significant cognitive dysfunction despite other therapies, referral to an expert in cognitive impairment, such as a neurologist, may be of benefit to determine whether other causes for cognitive dysfunction are present and if further diagnostic and therapeutic interventions are required. Some patients may also benefit from consultation with a clinical psychologist for neuropsychological (psychometric) testing. (See ""Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia"" and ""Mild cognitive impairment: Epidemiology, pathology, and clinical assessment"" and ""Mild cognitive impairment: Epidemiology, pathology, and clinical assessment"", section on 'Neuropsychological testing'.) FACTORS LIMITING TREATMENT EFFICACY — Several factors may limit the degree of benefit achieved with prescribed medications or other interventions, including nonadherence to treatment interventions or comorbidities that cause peripheral pain and that require additional interventions to those used for treatment of the fibromyalgia. (See 'Nonadherence to treatment recommendations' below and 'Treating peripheral pain' below.) Nonadherence to treatment recommendations — A lack of adherence to the prescribed treatment program is common in fibromyalgia and should also be evaluated as a potential cause of persistent symptoms. Noncompliance, whether due to forgetfulness, due to carelessness, or as an exercise of patient autonomy, may contribute to a lack of effectiveness of medications prescribed for patients with fibromyalgia. Adherence to advice by patients with fibromyalgia cared for by 10 rheumatologists was assessed in a study of 127 women with fibromyalgia recruited from both tertiary care hospitals and the community [25]. Overall, 47 percent of the women reported noncompliance with medications. The degree of discordance between a clinician’s and patient’s assessments of communication during, as well as patient satisfaction at the conclusion of, a clinician-patient encounter was a significant determinant of overall compliance. A large study using insurance claims data from the United States found that only 31 percent of fibromyalgia patients initiated treatment with one of the medications listed in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines [26]. These medications included pregabalin, gabapentin, duloxetine, milnacipran, cyclobenzaprine, tramadol, amitriptyline, and venlafaxine.

● A greater proportion of the patients treated with acetaminophen and tramadol had a 50 percent or greater reduction in pain (35 versus 18 percent with placebo). ● Those on the active combination had significantly greater overall decrease in pain (19 versus 7 mm on a 100 mm scale).",The study indicated that 35 percent of patients receiving the combination therapy experienced a 50 percent or greater reduction in pain.,The results suggested that the combination treatment did not lead to any significant improvements in self-reported health status compared to placebo.,"Although a greater proportion of patients experienced pain relief with the combination therapy, the long-term effectiveness of tramadol for chronic pain might still be questioned."

Complementary and alternative therapies — There is evidence that tai chi, yoga, and acupuncture may have benefit in fibromyalgia (see 'Meditative movement therapies' below and 'Acupuncture' below). These interventions may be of particular interest to some patients, especially those who wish to avoid the use of additional medications or the use of any medications at all. Efficacy of complementary and alternative therapies was evaluated in a 2015 systematic review of many forms of such therapies in fibromyalgia, which found consistently positive results for tai chi, yoga, meditation and mindfulness-based interventions, hypnosis or guided imagery, electromyogram (EMG) biofeedback, and balneotherapy/hydrotherapy [54].

Yoga and tai chi each significantly improved pain only in single randomized trials among those evaluated. Tai chi — Tai chi, which combines mind-body practice with gentle, flowing movement exercises, has shown some benefit for fibromyalgia symptoms, although it has not been extensively studied for this condition. A randomized trial involving 66 patients compared tai chi (one-hour sessions twice weekly) with a control intervention of wellness education and stretching, with significant improvement in the FIQ score in the group receiving tai chi after 12 weeks of the intervention (baseline versus 12-week scores of 63 ± 16 and 35 ± 19 versus 68 ± 11 and 59 ± 18, respectively) [56]. Improvements were maintained at 24 weeks, and no adverse events were observed. Another randomized 12-week trial involving 101 patients also showed benefit from tai chi [57]. In this trial, tai chi (practiced for 90 minutes twice weekly) was significantly more likely than a control intervention of education to provide worthwhile improvement in common fibromyalgia symptoms, including pain and functional mobility. Yoga — A randomized controlled trial evaluated a specific form of yoga, called Yoga of Awareness, in 53 fibromyalgia patients who were compared with waitlisted standard care. Those receiving the yoga program demonstrated greater improvements in pain, fatigue, and mood and in pain catastrophizing, acceptance, and other coping strategies [58]. Follow-up results showed that patients sustained most of their post-treatment gains, with the functional scores 21.9 percent improved at three months. Yoga practice rates were good, and more practice was associated with more benefit for a variety of outcomes [59]. Qigong — A systematic review of randomized controlled trials comparing qigong with control interventions revealed low-quality evidence for short-term improvement of pain, quality of life, and sleep quality, and very low-quality evidence for improvement of fatigue, and concluded that only a weak recommendation for qigong can be made at this point [60].

In this trial, tai chi (practiced for 90 minutes twice weekly) was significantly more likely than a control intervention of education to provide worthwhile improvement in common fibromyalgia symptoms, including pain and functional mobility. Yoga — A randomized controlled trial evaluated a specific form of yoga, called Yoga of Awareness, in 53 fibromyalgia patients who were compared with waitlisted standard care. Those receiving the yoga program demonstrated greater improvements in pain, fatigue, and mood and in pain catastrophizing, acceptance, and other coping strategies [58]. Follow-up results showed that patients sustained most of their post-treatment gains, with the functional scores 21.9 percent improved at three months. Yoga practice rates were good, and more practice was associated with more benefit for a variety of outcomes [59]. Qigong — A systematic review of randomized controlled trials comparing qigong with control interventions revealed low-quality evidence for short-term improvement of pain, quality of life, and sleep quality, and very low-quality evidence for improvement of fatigue, and concluded that only a weak recommendation for qigong can be made at this point [60].

./UTD2txt/17772.txt,"Among those who completed the assigned treatment, the response rates were higher in those receiving paroxetine than placebo (66 versus 33 percent, respectively). ● Fluvoxamine – Fluvoxamine was compared with amitriptyline in a study that randomly assigned 68 patients to one of the two active treatments for four weeks [52]. Withdrawals were more common in the amitriptyline group than in the fluvoxamine group (40 versus 16 percent).

In the initial report 32 patients with fibromyalgia were randomly assigned to receive sham stimulation, real tDCS with the anode centered over the primary motor cortex, or stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [67]. Direct current stimulation consisted of 2 mA for 20 minutes on five consecutive days with the anode placed on the scalp over the appropriate brain region. The change in pain was significantly greater in those who received real tDCS to the motor cortex than in the groups receiving sham or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the left prefrontal cortex, administered in a two-week randomized trial involving 20 patients with fibromyalgia, significantly reduced symptoms of pain from the level at baseline compared with sham TMS (mean reduction of 29 versus 4 percent) [68]. Symptoms of depression also improved. Another randomized trial investigated the effects of five consecutive 20-minute sessions of 2-mA anodal tDCS directed to the M1 in 48 patients (45 females) with fibromyalgia. There was a small but significant improvement in pain under the active tDCS condition but not under the sham condition. Fibromyalgia-related daily functioning improved in the active tDCS group compared with the sham group. The small effect sizes indicated that the results were unlikely to reflect clinically important changes.

A 2017 systematic review questioned the efficacy of routine use of repetitive TMS in fibromyalgia [70], while another 2017 systematic review did find evidence for the efficacy of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the primary motor cortex [71]. ● Occipital and C2 nerve stimulation – Several trials have evaluated the effect of occipital [72] and C2 nerve stimulation [73] The results were positive, but the trials were small and not well-controlled. Occipital nerve field transcranial direct current stimulation, in comparison to sham stimulation, normalized the dysfunctional brain connectivity between the pregenual cingulate cortex to the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [74]. ● Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation – Trials of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) have had mixed results and are inadequate to support the use of TENS for the treatment of fibromyalgia, although investigation of this approach is of interest because of the capacity of TENS to reduce central excitability and to activate central inhibition pathways [75-77]. (See ""Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain"", section on 'Transcutaneous electrical stimulation'.) A randomized crossover trial suggested that TENS may have short-term efficacy in fibromyalgia [75]. Patients reported significant decreases in pain and fatigue with movement immediately after a single course of active TENS compared with a course of treatment with placebo TENS and no TENS (improvement in pain with movement on a 10 cm visual analog scale of 1.11, 95% CI 0.59-1.63, versus 0.23, 95% CI 0.24-0.77, versus 0.26, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.75). Pressure pain thresholds increased at the site of TENS (spine) and outside the site of TENS (leg) compared with placebo or no TENS; and during active TENS, conditioned pain modulation was significantly stronger compared with placebo and no TENS.

A 2017 systematic review questioned the efficacy of routine use of repetitive TMS in fibromyalgia [70], while another 2017 systematic review did find evidence for the efficacy of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation over the primary motor cortex [71]. ● Occipital and C2 nerve stimulation – Several trials have evaluated the effect of occipital [72] and C2 nerve stimulation [73] The results were positive, but the trials were small and not well-controlled. Occipital nerve field transcranial direct current stimulation, in comparison to sham stimulation, normalized the dysfunctional brain connectivity between the pregenual cingulate cortex to the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [74]. ● Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation – Trials of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) have had mixed results and are inadequate to support the use of TENS for the treatment of fibromyalgia, although investigation of this approach is of interest because of the capacity of TENS to reduce central excitability and to activate central inhibition pathways [75-77]. (See ""Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain"", section on 'Transcutaneous electrical stimulation'.) A randomized crossover trial suggested that TENS may have short-term efficacy in fibromyalgia [75]. Patients reported significant decreases in pain and fatigue with movement immediately after a single course of active TENS compared with a course of treatment with placebo TENS and no TENS (improvement in pain with movement on a 10 cm visual analog scale of 1.11, 95% CI 0.59-1.63, versus 0.23, 95% CI 0.24-0.77, versus 0.26, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.75). Pressure pain thresholds increased at the site of TENS (spine) and outside the site of TENS (leg) compared with placebo or no TENS; and during active TENS, conditioned pain modulation was significantly stronger compared with placebo and no TENS. Two other studies with TENS noted improvement if fibromyalgia patients but also used an exercise program [76] or massage [77]. PHARMACOLOGIC TRIALS WITH LIMITED DATA IN FIBROMYALGIA
● Naltrexone – A pilot study found that low-dose naltrexone reduced pain more than placebo (29 versus 18 percent) [78]. Low-dose naltrexone was also associated with improved general satisfaction with life and with improved mood but was not associated with improved fatigue or sleep. ● Memantine – A randomized trial of memantine (20 mg daily), involving 63 patients, showed statistically significant reductions in pain and increases in pain threshold compared with placebo at one, three, and six months of study [79]. Memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is available for clinical use in the treatment of dementia. ● Pramipexole – Benefit from pramipexole, a dopamine agonist, was shown in a study that randomly assigned patients either to pramipexole (increased from 0.25 mg to a maximum of 4.5 mg every evening) or to placebo [80].",A systematic review concluded that repetitive TMS had a superior effect on the quality of life for fibromyalgia patients compared to sham stimulation.,"The evidence from studies on TENS contradicts the notion that it can effectively reduce pain in fibromyalgia patients, as many trials yielded inadequate results.","The small but significant improvement observed with active tDCS suggests potential benefits, yet the effect sizes indicate that these changes may not be clinically important."
./UTD2txt/17772.txt,"The most studied has been transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In the initial report 32 patients with fibromyalgia were randomly assigned to receive sham stimulation, real tDCS with the anode centered over the primary motor cortex, or stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [67]. Direct current stimulation consisted of 2 mA for 20 minutes on five consecutive days with the anode placed on the scalp over the appropriate brain region. The change in pain was significantly greater in those who received real tDCS to the motor cortex than in the groups receiving sham or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the left prefrontal cortex, administered in a two-week randomized trial involving 20 patients with fibromyalgia, significantly reduced symptoms of pain from the level at baseline compared with sham TMS (mean reduction of 29 versus 4 percent) [68]. Symptoms of depression also improved. Another randomized trial investigated the effects of five consecutive 20-minute sessions of 2-mA anodal tDCS directed to the M1 in 48 patients (45 females) with fibromyalgia. There was a small but significant improvement in pain under the active tDCS condition but not under the sham condition. Fibromyalgia-related daily functioning improved in the active tDCS group compared with the sham group.

./UTD2txt/1053.txt,"Nevertheless, susceptibility to rifampin should be reassessed when regimens containing rifampin fail [3]. STREPTOCOCCI — Most viridans group streptococci are highly penicillin susceptible, defined in the United States as a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≤0.12 mcg/mL. Occasional strains are relatively resistant to penicillin (MIC >0.12 mcg/mL and <0.5 mcg/mL), and rare strains are fully resistant to penicillin (MIC ≥0.5 mcg/mL) [23]. The American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines use these MIC parameters to guide the approach to treatment [1]; the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) guidelines and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines use different MIC parameters [2,24]. The preferred regimen for streptococcal prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) consists of combination therapy with a beta-lactam antibiotic and an aminoglycoside (if the isolate does not exhibit high-level aminoglycoside resistance). To provide maximal therapy, combination beta-lactam-aminoglycoside therapy is used to achieve synergistic killing of the organism; this synergistic interaction is similar to that seen with combination therapy for enterococcal endocarditis [25]. The addition of gentamicin to penicillin may be beneficial for treatment of PVE caused by penicillin-susceptible streptococci based on in vitro studies, in vivo studies using experimental endocarditis models, clinical series, and experience of experts  [4,26]. However, there are no studies that demonstrate the superiority of this combination therapy over that provided by penicillin alone. High-level resistance to streptomycin in viridans streptococci and S.gallolyticus (bovis) abrogates the bactericidal synergism of the penicillin-streptomycin combination [27-29], and it is likely that high-level resistance to gentamicin would preclude a synergistic interaction of penicillin with gentamicin. Considering the potential toxicity of gentamicin, it seems clinically prudent to test the viridans Streptococcus or S.gallolyticus for the presence of high-level gentamicin resistance before initiating combination therapy. In the absence of high-level gentamicin resistance, gentamicin (given as a single daily dose) may be given during the initial two weeks of treatment. (See 'Enterococci' below.) Studies have not been done evaluating for presence of high-level resistance to gentamicin in viridans streptococci and S.gallolyticus; high-level resistance to streptomycin has been identified in a small percentage of clinical isolates [27,28]. There is no Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)-approved methodology for screening these streptococci for high-level aminoglycoside resistance; the brain-heart infusion (BHI) agar plates commercially available for screening enterococci might be used. Growth of the isolate on BHI in the face of high concentrations of gentamicin or streptomycin would suggest high-level resistance that would likely preclude synergism with the respective aminoglycoside. In the absence of high-level streptomycin resistance, streptomycin may be given in lieu of gentamicin to achieve the same effect, but gentamicin is more commonly used in clinical practice due to the wider availability of laboratory testing for gentamicin serum levels and because dosing regimens for gentamicin are more familiar to most clinicians than dosing regimens for streptomycin. For these reasons, we favor gentamicin if the isolate does not exhibit high-level gentamicin resistance. Penicillin, a cephalosporin, or vancomycin can be used alone if aminoglycoside therapy is relatively contraindicated [3]. If the Streptococcus is relatively resistant to penicillin, the AHA recommends that the aminoglycoside be continued for the entire duration of therapy, if not precluded by nephrotoxicity . Here too, for the reasons noted above, it is prudent to screen the streptococcus for high-level aminoglycoside resistance and not use an aminoglycoside to which the organism possesses high-level resistance. In such cases wherein combination therapy will not be synergistic, vancomycin monotherapy might be preferable. Although there is a theoretical benefit to a longer course of aminoglycoside therapy when treating PVE caused by these relatively resistant strains, there are not sufficient data upon which to base recommendations on duration of therapy or dosing frequency. If the isolate has a penicillin MIC >0.12 mcg/mL, gentamicin should be administered in three divided doses for two weeks. If the isolate has a penicillin MIC is ≥0.5 mcg/mL or if PVE is caused by Abiotrophia defectiva, Granulicatella spp, or Gemella spp, gentamicin should be administered in three divided doses for six weeks. This guidance is based on limited data generated from native valve endocarditis treatment and the risk of enhanced aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity with longer courses of therapy. If the patient is intolerant of penicillin and ceftriaxone, vancomycin monotherapy can be used; concurrent gentamicin treatment is not advised because of the increased risk of nephrotoxicity when these vancomycin and gentamicin are administered concurrently. Among patients who are allergic to penicillin, vancomycin is advised for those with immediate-type reactions (urticaria or anaphylaxis). Cefotaxime or ceftriaxone may be used in non–immediate type allergies. (See ""Allergy evaluation for immediate penicillin allergy: Skin test-based diagnostic strategies and cross-reactivity with other beta-lactam antibiotics"".) Antibiotic therapy for PVE caused by penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (in the absence of meningitis) or a Streptococcus belonging to serogroups A, B, C, F, and G consists of penicillin or ceftriaxone as recommended for penicillin-susceptible viridans streptococci . For serogroups B, C, F, and G, gentamicin may be administered for the initial two weeks. For treatment of PVE due to S.pneumoniae with penicillin resistant (MIC ≥0.12 mcg/mL) in the absence of meningitis, the regimens in the  be used . In the setting of PVE due to penicillin-resistant pneumococci complicated by meningitis, the regimen must be adjusted to ensure adequate antimicrobial penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid (with meningeal doses of ceftriaxone, vancomycin, or both). (See ""Initial therapy and prognosis of bacterial meningitis in adults"".) ENTEROCOCCI — Bactericidal activity against enterococci requires the synergistic interaction of a cell wall active agent (penicillin, ampicillin, or vancomycin) and an aminoglycoside (gentamicin or streptomycin) [25] (see ""Antimicrobial therapy of native valve endocarditis""). To achieve this interaction, the organism must not be resistant to the cell wall active agent at achievable serum concentrations and must not be resistant to gentamicin at 500 mcg/mL or streptomycin at 1000 mcg/mL in broth or at 2000 mcg/mL when using cultures on agar.",The American Heart Association guidelines recommend using specific MIC parameters to determine treatment strategies for streptococcal infections.,Studies have proven that combination therapy with gentamicin and penicillin is superior to using penicillin alone for treating PVE caused by viridans streptococci.,"While gentamicin is often preferred in clinical practice, its efficacy compared to other aminoglycosides like streptomycin remains uncertain."

Considering the potential toxicity of gentamicin, it seems clinically prudent to test the viridans Streptococcus or S.gallolyticus for the presence of high-level gentamicin resistance before initiating combination therapy. In the absence of high-level gentamicin resistance, gentamicin (given as a single daily dose) may be given during the initial two weeks of treatment. (See 'Enterococci' below.) Studies have not been done evaluating for presence of high-level resistance to gentamicin in viridans streptococci and S.gallolyticus; high-level resistance to streptomycin has been identified in a small percentage of clinical isolates [27,28]. There is no Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)-approved methodology for screening these streptococci for high-level aminoglycoside resistance; the brain-heart infusion (BHI) agar plates commercially available for screening enterococci might be used. Growth of the isolate on BHI in the face of high concentrations of gentamicin or streptomycin would suggest high-level resistance that would likely preclude synergism with the respective aminoglycoside. In the absence of high-level streptomycin resistance, streptomycin may be given in lieu of gentamicin to achieve the same effect, but gentamicin is more commonly used in clinical practice due to the wider availability of laboratory testing for gentamicin serum levels and because dosing regimens for gentamicin are more familiar to most clinicians than dosing regimens for streptomycin. For these reasons, we favor gentamicin if the isolate does not exhibit high-level gentamicin resistance. Penicillin, a cephalosporin, or vancomycin can be used alone if aminoglycoside therapy is relatively contraindicated [3]. If the Streptococcus is relatively resistant to penicillin, the AHA recommends that the aminoglycoside be continued for the entire duration of therapy, if not precluded by nephrotoxicity . Here too, for the reasons noted above, it is prudent to screen the streptococcus for high-level aminoglycoside resistance and not use an aminoglycoside to which the organism possesses high-level resistance. In such cases wherein combination therapy will not be synergistic, vancomycin monotherapy might be preferable. Although there is a theoretical benefit to a longer course of aminoglycoside therapy when treating PVE caused by these relatively resistant strains, there are not sufficient data upon which to base recommendations on duration of therapy or dosing frequency. If the isolate has a penicillin MIC >0.12 mcg/mL, gentamicin should be administered in three divided doses for two weeks. If the isolate has a penicillin MIC is ≥0.5 mcg/mL or if PVE is caused by Abiotrophia defectiva, Granulicatella spp, or Gemella spp, gentamicin should be administered in three divided doses for six weeks. This guidance is based on limited data generated from native valve endocarditis treatment and the risk of enhanced aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity with longer courses of therapy. If the patient is intolerant of penicillin and ceftriaxone, vancomycin monotherapy can be used; concurrent gentamicin treatment is not advised because of the increased risk of nephrotoxicity when these vancomycin and gentamicin are administered concurrently. Among patients who are allergic to penicillin, vancomycin is advised for those with immediate-type reactions (urticaria or anaphylaxis). Cefotaxime or ceftriaxone may be used in non–immediate type allergies. (See ""Allergy evaluation for immediate penicillin allergy: Skin test-based diagnostic strategies and cross-reactivity with other beta-lactam antibiotics"".) Antibiotic therapy for PVE caused by penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (in the absence of meningitis) or a Streptococcus belonging to serogroups A, B, C, F, and G consists of penicillin or ceftriaxone as recommended for penicillin-susceptible viridans streptococci . For serogroups B, C, F, and G, gentamicin may be administered for the initial two weeks. For treatment of PVE due to S.pneumoniae with penicillin resistant (MIC ≥0.12 mcg/mL) in the absence of meningitis, the regimens in the  be used . In the setting of PVE due to penicillin-resistant pneumococci complicated by meningitis, the regimen must be adjusted to ensure adequate antimicrobial penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid (with meningeal doses of ceftriaxone, vancomycin, or both). (See ""Initial therapy and prognosis of bacterial meningitis in adults"".) ENTEROCOCCI — Bactericidal activity against enterococci requires the synergistic interaction of a cell wall active agent (penicillin, ampicillin, or vancomycin) and an aminoglycoside (gentamicin or streptomycin) [25] (see ""Antimicrobial therapy of native valve endocarditis""). To achieve this interaction, the organism must not be resistant to the cell wall active agent at achievable serum concentrations and must not be resistant to gentamicin at 500 mcg/mL or streptomycin at 1000 mcg/mL in broth or at 2000 mcg/mL when using cultures on agar.",Combination therapy with beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides is preferred for treating streptococcal prosthetic valve endocarditis.,Vancomycin monotherapy is always the best choice for patients with penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae.,"The duration of aminoglycoside therapy for resistant strains is not clearly defined, leading to varying recommendations among clinicians."
./UTD2txt/1053.txt,"Nevertheless, susceptibility to rifampin should be reassessed when regimens containing rifampin fail [3]. STREPTOCOCCI — Most viridans group streptococci are highly penicillin susceptible, defined in the United States as a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) ≤0.12 mcg/mL. Occasional strains are relatively resistant to penicillin (MIC >0.12 mcg/mL and <0.5 mcg/mL), and rare strains are fully resistant to penicillin (MIC ≥0.5 mcg/mL) [23]. The American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines use these MIC parameters to guide the approach to treatment [1]; the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) guidelines and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines use different MIC parameters [2,24]. The preferred regimen for streptococcal prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) consists of combination therapy with a beta-lactam antibiotic and an aminoglycoside (if the isolate does not exhibit high-level aminoglycoside resistance). To provide maximal therapy, combination beta-lactam-aminoglycoside therapy is used to achieve synergistic killing of the organism; this synergistic interaction is similar to that seen with combination therapy for enterococcal endocarditis [25]. The addition of gentamicin to penicillin may be beneficial for treatment of PVE caused by penicillin-susceptible streptococci based on in vitro studies, in vivo studies using experimental endocarditis models, clinical series, and experience of experts  [4,26]. However, there are no studies that demonstrate the superiority of this combination therapy over that provided by penicillin alone.

However, antibiotic resistance among enterococci has become significantly more common, necessitating careful testing of each strain causing endocarditis to select a synergistic regimen [31,32].

In general, daptomycin is active against enterococci, including VRE, although there are no approved susceptibility breakpoints for daptomycin (enterococci with minimum inhibitory concentration >4.0 mcg/mL are likely resistant). Clinical experience with daptomycin is limited to case reports, raising important concerns regarding reporting bias [40]. In general, daptomycin should be used in high doses (10 to 12 mg/kg) and combined with either ampicillin or ceftaroline when treating PVE caused by VRE. Management of enterococcal endocarditis in circumstances where resistance precludes use of standard regimens should prompt infectious disease consultation. Surgical intervention during suppressive bacteriostatic therapy should be strongly considered when PVE is caused by highly resistant enterococci. (See ""Treatment of enterococcal infections"".)

When these combinations are precluded by the resistance pattern of the organism or the patient's risk for aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity, the high-dose ceftriaxone-ampicillin is a reasonable alternative regimen.","For staphylococcal endocarditis, a combination of three agents, including rifampin, is recommended for effective treatment.",The treatment approach for staphylococcal PVE is entirely different from that for coagulase-negative Staphylococcus.,"The choice of treatment for staphylococcal PVE depends on methicillin sensitivity, but it is uncertain how this affects overall treatment outcomes."

SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS — Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately. (See ""Society guideline links: Treatment and prevention of infective endocarditis"".) SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
● Treatment of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is more difficult than treatment of native valve endocarditis (NVE) and may require surgical replacement of the prostheses in addition to antibiotic therapy. (See 'Introduction' above.)
● Identification of the causative organism is critical to determine the most appropriate antimicrobial regimens. (See 'Introduction' above.)
● We recommend the same antimicrobial regimens for a specific pathogen causing PVE as is used for that organism when it causes native valve endocarditis (Grade 1B) but usually for longer duration. An exception is staphylococcal endocarditis; for this microorganism, we recommend treatment with three agents in combination, with one of these being rifampin (Grade 1B). (See 'General principles' above and 'Staphylococci' above.)
● We recommend treatment of PVE with an agent(s) that is bactericidal for the isolated microorganism for at least six weeks (Grade 1C). (See 'General principles' above.)
● Treatment choices for staphylococcal PVE are the same regardless of whether the pathogen is coagulase-negative Staphylococcus or S.aureus. The primary consideration in choosing therapy hinges upon whether or not the organism is sensitive to methicillin. (See 'Staphylococci' above.)
● We recommend a treatment regimen for enterococcal PVE that includes the synergistic interaction of a cell wall active agent (penicillin, ampicillin, or vancomycin) and an aminoglycoside (gentamicin or streptomycin) if possible (Grade 1B).

./UTD2txt/13514.txt,"The dosing of lipid-based formulations of amphotericin B is discussed below. (See 'Dosing' below.) Method of administration — Amphotericin B is most commonly administered intravenously, but direct or local instillation of amphotericin B has been used in several clinical circumstances. Intravenous — Intravenous infusions are prepared by combining amphotericin B with 5 percent dextrose in water (D5W) at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL. Although the incidence of acute hypersensitivity reactions from amphotericin B is rare, a test dose of 1 mg has been recommended. The test dose can be given as an aliquot of the initial infusion, followed by the remainder of the dose if there is no apparent reaction within 30 minutes. However, tolerance of the test dose does not exclude other amphotericin B toxicities. Infusion times are traditionally four to six hours. Amphotericin B has been given over shorter time periods (eg, 45 to 60 minutes), but infusion-related reactions (such as fever) may be more frequent, and this method is not recommended [11]. The practice of titrating the daily dose to the target dose over several days has not been proven to lessen adverse reactions and may delay optimal therapy. Intravenous administration of the total daily dose of amphotericin B given as a continuous infusion over 24 hours has been associated with less nephrotoxicity compared with administration over four hours [12]. However, the efficacy of this administration schedule for patients with established infections has not been proven. Furthermore, amphotericin B exhibits concentration-dependent pharmacodynamics that may be compromised by continuous infusion. Continuous infusion of amphotericin B is not US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and is not recommended. Administration of premedications to patients receiving amphotericin B should be considered to prevent infusion-related reactions and nephrotoxicity. (See 'Adverse effects' below.) Bladder irrigation — Irrigation of the bladder with amphotericin B has been used in the treatment of candiduria. There have been several non-blinded randomized trials comparing amphotericin B bladder irrigation with oral fluconazole [13,14]. Although the use of amphotericin B bladder irrigation resulted in clearing of candiduria in many patients, relapses were routinely observed after several weeks. Traditionally, 50 mg of amphotericin B has been added to 1000 mL sterile water for irrigation and given as a continuous bladder irrigation daily for a period of five days. However, this regimen requires the presence of an indwelling bladder catheter, which itself is a risk factor for candiduria. Shorter treatment courses (one day) or reduced doses (as low as 5 mg/day) have been recommended by some authors [15,16]. Current published guidelines on the treatment of candiduria do not recommend the routine use of amphotericin B bladder irrigation, except in exceptional circumstances, such as treatment of adult nonneutropenic patients with symptomatic cystitis due to fluconazole-resistant species (C.glabrata, C.krusei) [17]. (See ""Candida infections of the bladder and kidneys"", section on 'Fluconazole-resistant Candida'.) Intraperitoneal — Local instillation of amphotericin B has also been reported in the treatment of fungal peritonitis (alone or in combination with intravenous therapy). This practice is discouraged because it causes abdominal pain and can contribute to adhesion formation and loss of the peritoneum as a dialyzing membrane. Patients with fungal peritonitis should be treated with catheter removal and systemic antifungal therapy [17]. (See ""Fungal peritonitis in continuous peritoneal dialysis"", section on 'Treatment'.) Intrathecal — Intrathecal administration of amphotericin B deoxycholate in the lumbar subarachnoid space has been used primarily for the treatment of coccidioidal meningitis. Target doses generally range from 0.1 to 1.5 mg at intervals ranging from daily to weekly [18]; lower doses (ie, 0.01 mg) can be started and increased slowly until target doses are reached or the patient shows signs of intolerance [19].","Amphotericin B is primarily administered intravenously, but alternative methods like direct instillation have been utilized in specific clinical scenarios.",The incidence of acute hypersensitivity reactions from amphotericin B is common and requires a test dose before administration.,"Although amphotericin B bladder irrigation has shown effectiveness in clearing candiduria, the frequent relapses suggest that its long-term efficacy is uncertain."

Adverse effectsInfusion-related reactions — Infusion-related reactions, particularly nausea, vomiting, chills, and rigors, are common with IV amphotericin B deoxycholate administration, usually occurring either during infusion (within 15 minutes to 3 hours following initiation) or immediately following administration of the dose. Treatment of amphotericin B–related nausea and vomiting (as well as prevention of subsequent reactions) may require the use of a phenothiazine, such as promethazine (usual adult dose 12.5 to 25 mg every four to six hours by mouth, intramuscularly [IM], IV, or per rectum [PR]), prochlorperazine (usual adult dose 10 mg IM or IV or 25 mg PR every four to six hours), or ondansetron. Phlebitis is a complication that primarily occurs in patients receiving infusions via a small peripheral vein.",Only experienced professionals should perform cisternal injections due to the risks involved.,Infusion-related reactions are rare and do not typically occur during IV amphotericin B administration.,"While infusion-related reactions like chills and nausea are common, some patients might not experience these symptoms."

./UTD2txt/13514.txt,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents may also be useful in this setting. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, ibuprofen administered 30 minutes prior to amphotericin B deoxycholate reduced the rate of occurrence of chills from 87 percent to 49 percent [25]. Meperidine (usual adult dose 25 to 50 mg IM or IV) may reduce amphotericin B–induced chills and rigors. However, meperidine is not routinely recommended for premedication due to its potential side effects. Nephrotoxicity — Intravenous amphotericin B administration may result in nephrotoxicity. With amphotericin B deoxycholate, a reversible and often transient decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) has been described in 5 to 80 percent of patients. The net effect is an elevation (above baseline) in the serum creatinine concentration.

./UTD2txt/13514.txt,"Thus, their use should be considered investigational and is discouraged. DRUG INTERACTIONS — The following interactions are of particular concern with the use of amphotericin B:
● Amphotericin B should not be given concurrently or sequentially with other nephrotoxic agents, if possible. (See ""Amphotericin B nephrotoxicity"".)
● Patients receiving digoxin or skeletal muscle relaxants may be predisposed to toxicity or enhanced effect of these agents following amphotericin B–induced hypokalemia. (See ""Cardiac arrhythmias due to digoxin toxicity"".)
● There are data linking amphotericin B and acute pulmonary reactions in patients receiving concomitant leukocyte transfusions, but these reactions also can occur without administering leukocyte transfusions. Infusions of amphotericin B should be separated as far apart as possible from leukocyte transfusions whenever possible [2]. SUMMARY
● Amphotericin B is a polyene antifungal agent with activity in vitro against a wide variety of fungal pathogens. Amphotericin B exerts its antifungal effect by disruption of fungal cell wall synthesis because of its ability to bind to sterols, primarily ergosterol, which leads to the formation of pores that allow leakage of cellular components. Amphotericin B is generally considered cidal against susceptible fungi at clinically relevant concentrations. (See 'Introduction' above.)
● Activity of amphotericin B has been demonstrated in vitro against a wide variety of clinical fungal isolates, including Candida spp, Aspergillus spp, the Mucorales, all of the endemic mycoses, and most hyaline and brown-black molds. Activity has also been demonstrated against Leishmania spp. Organisms that are usually resistant to amphotericin B include the organisms that cause chromoblastomycosis, as well as Aspergillus terreus, Candida lusitaniae, Scedosporium spp, and some Fusarium spp. (See 'Spectrum of activity' above.)
● Because of the toxicities associated with its intravenous use along with the expanded availability of safer treatment options, amphotericin B is frequently reserved for patients who have severe, life-threatening invasive fungal infections or who are unable to tolerate alternative antifungal agents. (See 'Introduction' above.)
● Little is known about the pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B. The pharmacokinetic profiles of the lipid formulations of amphotericin B differ from those of amphotericin B deoxycholate and from each other. (See 'Pharmacokinetics' above.)

● Amphotericin B is a polyene antifungal agent with activity in vitro against a wide variety of fungal pathogens.

./UTD2txt/8711.txt,"The likelihood and severity of IRIS correlates with two interrelated factors: 1 the extent of CD4+ T cell immune suppression prior to the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 2 the degree of viral suppression and immune recovery following the initiation of ART. As the half-life of HIV is generally between one and four days, ART may produce a greater than 90 percent reduction in the overall HIV viral burden within one to two weeks of starting treatment. This decline in viral load usually persists during the next 8 to 12 weeks and then stabilizes. Declines in the viral load are even faster with integrase strand transfer inhibitors. An increase in immune effector cells occurs in inverse proportion to the fall in HIV viral load in most treated individuals. (See ""Patient monitoring during HIV antiretroviral therapy"".) The typical recovery of CD4+ T lymphocyte count following initiation of ART is biphasic [17-19]. A rapid increase in CD4+ cells occurs during the first three to six months of ART. This initial rise is mainly due to an increase in the numbers of CD45RO+ memory T cells and is presumed to be due to a combination of decreased lymphocyte apoptosis and simultaneous redistribution of lymphocytes from peripheral lymphoid tissues into the circulation. Thereafter, a slower increase of predominately naive CD4+ T cells (CD45RA+, CD62L+) occurs in most treated individuals. This secondary increase in CD4+ T cells is thought to be due to expansion of T cell clones produced by the thymus prior to its age-related functional decline and/or occurs secondary to thymopoiesis [20-22]. CD8+ T lymphocytes also increase rapidly after the initiation of ART. However, the total numbers of CD8+ T lymphocytes eventually stabilize as memory CD8+ cells subsequently decline and are replaced by naive CD8+ T lymphocytes [18]. Increases in T lymphocytes after initiation of ART are also accompanied by increased in vitro lymphocyte proliferation responses, increased markers of immune activation, and pathogen-specific delayed hypersensitivity [18,19,23,24]. As an example, one group of investigators studying a small group of HIV-infected patients demonstrated that inducible lymphocyte proliferation increased almost threefold after three weeks of ART, ultimately rose fourfold, then stabilized for the next two years [18]. In vitro lymphocyte proliferation against Candida antigens as well as increases in stimulation indices with CMV antigens and tuberculin also typically occur after initiation of ART in HIV-infected patients [19,23]. Another study demonstrated that 90 percent of HIV-infected patients had cutaneous anergy prior to starting ART; 12 weeks later, 30 percent of these patients had recovered their ability to respond to skin test antigens [23]. DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR IRIS — There is no universally agreed-upon definition for the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). However, it is generally accepted that the diagnosis of IRIS requires the worsening of a recognized (""paradoxical"" IRIS) or unrecognized preexisting infection (""unmasking"" IRIS) in the setting of improving immunologic function [25,26]. Most or all of the following features should be present in order to make the diagnosis:
● The presence of AIDS with a low pretreatment CD4 count (often less than 100 cells/microL) [27,28]. One important exception to this general rule is tuberculosis. IRIS secondary to preexisting M.tuberculosis infection may occur in individuals with CD4 counts >200 cells/microL. ● A positive virologic and immunological response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) [29,30].",The severity of IRIS is linked to the level of CD4+ T cell immune suppression before starting ART and the effectiveness of viral suppression after treatment begins.,Evidence suggests that initiating ART does not lead to a significant reduction in HIV viral load within the first two weeks of treatment.,"While some patients experience an increase in immune response markers after starting ART, the long-term stability of these responses remains uncertain."

However, the total numbers of CD8+ T lymphocytes eventually stabilize as memory CD8+ cells subsequently decline and are replaced by naive CD8+ T lymphocytes [18]. Increases in T lymphocytes after initiation of ART are also accompanied by increased in vitro lymphocyte proliferation responses, increased markers of immune activation, and pathogen-specific delayed hypersensitivity [18,19,23,24]. As an example, one group of investigators studying a small group of HIV-infected patients demonstrated that inducible lymphocyte proliferation increased almost threefold after three weeks of ART, ultimately rose fourfold, then stabilized for the next two years [18]. In vitro lymphocyte proliferation against Candida antigens as well as increases in stimulation indices with CMV antigens and tuberculin also typically occur after initiation of ART in HIV-infected patients [19,23]. Another study demonstrated that 90 percent of HIV-infected patients had cutaneous anergy prior to starting ART; 12 weeks later, 30 percent of these patients had recovered their ability to respond to skin test antigens [23]. DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR IRIS — There is no universally agreed-upon definition for the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). However, it is generally accepted that the diagnosis of IRIS requires the worsening of a recognized (""paradoxical"" IRIS) or unrecognized preexisting infection (""unmasking"" IRIS) in the setting of improving immunologic function [25,26]. Most or all of the following features should be present in order to make the diagnosis:
● The presence of AIDS with a low pretreatment CD4 count (often less than 100 cells/microL) [27,28]. One important exception to this general rule is tuberculosis. IRIS secondary to preexisting M.tuberculosis infection may occur in individuals with CD4 counts >200 cells/microL. ● A positive virologic and immunological response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) [29,30].","A rapid increase in CD4+ T lymphocyte count typically occurs within the first three to six months of ART, primarily due to the rise in memory T cells.",The increase in CD4+ T lymphocytes following ART is not associated with any changes in lymphocyte apoptosis.,"The recovery of CD4+ T cells post-ART could be influenced by various factors, making it difficult to determine the primary cause of the observed increases."
./UTD2txt/8711.txt,"The likelihood and severity of IRIS correlates with two interrelated factors: 1 the extent of CD4+ T cell immune suppression prior to the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and 2 the degree of viral suppression and immune recovery following the initiation of ART. As the half-life of HIV is generally between one and four days, ART may produce a greater than 90 percent reduction in the overall HIV viral burden within one to two weeks of starting treatment. This decline in viral load usually persists during the next 8 to 12 weeks and then stabilizes. Declines in the viral load are even faster with integrase strand transfer inhibitors. An increase in immune effector cells occurs in inverse proportion to the fall in HIV viral load in most treated individuals. (See ""Patient monitoring during HIV antiretroviral therapy"".) The typical recovery of CD4+ T lymphocyte count following initiation of ART is biphasic [17-19]. A rapid increase in CD4+ cells occurs during the first three to six months of ART. This initial rise is mainly due to an increase in the numbers of CD45RO+ memory T cells and is presumed to be due to a combination of decreased lymphocyte apoptosis and simultaneous redistribution of lymphocytes from peripheral lymphoid tissues into the circulation. Thereafter, a slower increase of predominately naive CD4+ T cells (CD45RA+, CD62L+) occurs in most treated individuals.

DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS — The differential diagnosis of an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is broad and includes progression of the initial opportunistic infection (OI) due to antimicrobial resistance or nonadherence to prescribed drug regimens, development of a new OI, or drug toxicity. INCIDENCE — Early retrospective case series studies suggested that up to 30 percent of patients who responded to antiretroviral therapy (ART) developed one or more inflammatory syndromes consistent with an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) [2,27]. However, subsequent data have suggested that the incidence is probably much lower, particularly in patients where ART was initiated before severe CD4 decline occurs. Data from prospective and retrospective studies suggest that the incidence of IRIS following ART is largely dependent on two things: 1 the likelihood of a preexisting opportunistic infection and 2 the likelihood of a viral and immunologic response to ART. The following studies illustrate the incidence of cases that have been reported in a variety of settings and the range of infections that have been described:
● In a systematic review and meta-analysis of about 13,000 HIV patients, 13 percent of subjects developed IRIS [34]. Some of the most common diagnoses included tuberculosis, herpes infections, cryptococcal meningitis, CMV retinitis, and PML. ● In a prospective trial that evaluated the optimum management of patients with AIDS-related opportunistic infections (A5164), the incidence of IRIS was 7.6 percent, which occurred a median of 33 days after the initiation of ART [26]. ● In another prospective cohort study in South Africa, an overall incidence rate of 25 cases of IRIS per 100 patient-years was reported, affecting approximately 10 percent of subjects [31]. PATHOGENS ASSOCIATED WITH IRIS — Many different pathogens have been associated with the development of an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) [3,31,35-47]. The leading pathogens include:
● Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
● Mycobacterium avium complex
● Cytomegalovirus 
● Cryptococcus neoformans
● Pneumocystis jirovecii
● Herpes simplex virus
● Hepatitis B virus
● Human herpes virus 8 (associated with Kaposi sarcoma) Some case reports have also documented IRIS associated with: hepatitis C virus, parvovirus B19 [35], Candida albicans, Epstein Barr Virus, herpes simplex, Bartonella henselae, Histoplasma capsulatum [36], dermatophytosis [37], leprosy [38-40], bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) [41], Talaromyces (Penicillium) marneffei [42], Schistosoma mansoni [43], and molluscum contagiosum virus. In addition, some patients with Kaposi sarcoma have developed an IRIS-like syndrome when antiretroviral therapy (ART) was initiated [31,45,46], and other patients have developed Grave's thyrotoxicosis or recurrence of sarcoidosis after starting ART. RISK FACTORS — Several studies have demonstrated that lower CD4 cell counts or high HIV RNA at the time of treatment initiation increase the risk of developing an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) [2,26-28,31,47]. Response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) also plays an important role in predicting risk. In one prospective trial of 282 patients with AIDS-related OIs, the risk of IRIS was related to low CD4 counts at baseline (HR = 0.79 per 10 additional CD4 cells/microL; 95% CI 0.65, 0.97) and degree of immunologic improvement on ART (HR = 1.08 per additional 10 CD4 cells/microL; 95% CI 1.03, 1.13) [26]. Similarly, the risk of IRIS was also associated with a higher level of viremia at baseline (HR = 2.5 per 1 log increase in HIV RNA; 95% CI 1.19, 5.21) and the degree of viral decline on ART (HR = 0.43 per 1 log increase in HIV RNA; 95% CI 0.24, 0.78). Fungal infections (except for Pneumocystis) were also associated with an increased risk of IRIS in the multivariate analysis. CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS — Most patients with an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) develop symptoms within one week to a few months after the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART).

The paradoxical reaction that follows the commencement of antituberculosis therapy for pulmonary TB is usually characterized by fever, malaise, weight loss, and worsening respiratory symptoms. Transient worsening of radiographic abnormalities, including new parenchymal opacities and progressive intrathoracic lymph node enlargement may also occur in such patients. Rarely pulmonary involvement may progress to severe respiratory compromise and adult respiratory distress syndrome. Patients with extrapulmonary TB may develop worsening lymphadenitis [10,49], new pleural effusions [50,51], the reappearance of fever with new infiltrates [52], or expansion of preexisting intracranial tuberculomas [11,53-55] after antituberculosis therapy is begun. Aspiration of fluctuant lymph nodes often reveals purulent material, but mycobacterial cultures are typically sterile and acid fast stains yield relatively few or no organisms.

The paradoxical reaction that follows the commencement of antituberculosis therapy for pulmonary TB is usually characterized by fever, malaise, weight loss, and worsening respiratory symptoms. Transient worsening of radiographic abnormalities, including new parenchymal opacities and progressive intrathoracic lymph node enlargement may also occur in such patients. Rarely pulmonary involvement may progress to severe respiratory compromise and adult respiratory distress syndrome. Patients with extrapulmonary TB may develop worsening lymphadenitis [10,49], new pleural effusions [50,51], the reappearance of fever with new infiltrates [52], or expansion of preexisting intracranial tuberculomas [11,53-55] after antituberculosis therapy is begun. Aspiration of fluctuant lymph nodes often reveals purulent material, but mycobacterial cultures are typically sterile and acid fast stains yield relatively few or no organisms. When mycobacteria are recovered in patients with paradoxical reactions, these organisms usually have not developed new antituberculous drug resistance [48].","IRIS can manifest in both localized and systemic forms, highlighting the diverse nature of the syndrome.",Patients with tuberculosis never experience symptoms such as malaise or weight loss after starting antituberculosis therapy.,The transient worsening of symptoms following antituberculosis therapy could either indicate a self-limiting phenomenon or a more serious underlying issue.

./UTD2txt/8711.txt,"The mechanism for paradoxical reactions is not well understood, but it appears to be immune mediated. Changes in the ability to respond to tuberculin proteins occur in some patients following the initiation of antituberculous therapy. For example, in one study, 74 percent of patients who were initially anergic had reversion of their previously negative tuberculin skin tests within two weeks of starting antituberculous therapy [56]. The incidence of paradoxical reactions in HIV-uninfected patients may be higher in patients who develop TB while receiving the immunomodulator infliximab [13]. (See ""Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors and mycobacterial infections"".) The incidence of paradoxical worsening associated with pulmonary TB is higher in HIV-infected individuals following ART initiation compared with those who are not coinfected with HIV [57-59]. As an example, in a prospective study paradoxical inflammatory reactions were documented in 12 of 33 patients (36 percent) coinfected with HIV and treated with ART, but similar reactions occurred in only 1 of 55 patients (2 percent) without HIV [60]. A retrospective review found severe transient worsening of chest radiograph appearance in 7 of 31 patients (23 percent) who were coinfected with HIV and TB and treated for both, and in 2 of 56 patients (4 percent; 26 patients with HIV coinfection and 30 patients without HIV) who were only receiving therapy for TB [61]. In a retrospective cohort of 144 HIV patients with TB coinfection, 11 (8 percent) had a paradoxical reaction after a median time of 47 days following ART initiation and an incidence rate of 15 cases per 100 patient-years [62]. Patients who are coinfected with TB and HIV may also develop IRIS that manifests as tuberculous lymphadenitis [63], cutaneous lesions [60], peritonitis [64], epididymitis [64], bowel perforation [65], or granulomatous nephritis [66]. The time interval from initiation of ART to the onset of IRIS associated with TB has varied from 10 to 180 days [3], but tends to occur within the first 60 days of starting ART therapy [6,67]. Mycobacterium avium complex — Patients coinfected with HIV and M.avium complex (MAC) may develop inflammatory reactions following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy ( and image 1 and ) [68-71]. IRIS due to MAC often manifests as fever and painful lymphadenitis that occurs one to eight weeks after ART is commenced [3,70-72]. The majority of patients with IRIS due to treated MAC infection have negative blood and bone marrow cultures. In contrast to findings in patients with AIDS and untreated MAC infection, biopsies of lymph nodes of patients with IRIS secondary to MAC can reveal well-formed granulomas with relatively few visible organisms [73]. (See ""Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections in HIV-infected patients"", section on 'Lymphadenitis'.) Individual case reports or small case series also exist describing IRIS syndrome manifesting as necrotic subcutaneous nodules, osteomyelitis, bursitis [1], granulomatous hepatitis, paravertebral abscesses [3], brain abscess [74], worsening lung infiltrates, or diffuse intestinal involvement presenting with abdominal pain [75]. (See ""Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections in HIV-infected patients"", section on 'Uncommon manifestations'.) IRIS associated with preexisting cryptococcal infection — HIV-infected patients previously infected with Cryptococcus spp.may develop symptoms of IRIS localized to the central nervous system (CNS) or the lungs [76]. Symptoms often occur within two months after commencement of therapy, but may be delayed for more than six months [76-78]. Despite the use of concurrent antifungal therapy, patients with preexisting cryptococcal meningoencephalitis may develop fever, increased headache, nausea, eye pain, photophobia, and nuchal rigidity following the initiation of ART [79]. (See ""Clinical management and monitoring during antifungal therapy of the HIV-infected patient with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis"", section on 'Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome'.) At the time of initial cryptococcal meningoencephalitis diagnosis, a paucity of CSF inflammation (eg, WBC <25 cells/microL) have been associated with development of IRIS [80]. Conversely, follow-up lumbar puncture in patients with IRIS associated with cryptococcal meningitis often reveals more inflammatory cells than were found prior to the initiation of antifungal therapy and ART; however, cultures usually remain sterile. One retrospective study found that compared with classic forms of AIDS-related cryptococcal meningitis, patients with IRIS-related cryptococcal meningitis had significantly higher opening pressures, CSF WBC counts (56 versus 12 cells/microL), CD4 cell counts, and lower HIV viral loads [81,82]. HIV-infected patients with preexisting cryptococcal pulmonary infection may develop cavitary lung lesions, hypoxia, respiratory failure, and ARDS following the initiation of ART [3,83]. Rarely, patients with disseminated cryptococcal infections may develop mediastinal lymphadenitis, hypercalcemia, and cutaneous abscesses as part of the IRIS syndrome [83,84]. IRIS associated with cytomegalovirus — IRIS due to prior cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection has been termed ""immune recovery uveitis"" (IRU) or ""immune recovery vitritis"" by various investigators [85,86]. IRIS has been reported in 16 to 63 percent of HIV-infected patients with CMV retinitis following the initiation of ART [29,86,87]. In one study the median time to IRU following ART initiation was 43 weeks, but onset can occur as early as four weeks or as late as four years in some patients [85,86]. (See ""Treatment of AIDS-related cytomegalovirus retinitis"", section on 'CMV immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes'.) IRU may manifest with some or all of the following: painless floaters, blurred vision, photopia (the sensation of flashing lights), decreased visual acuity, or ocular pain. Patients with IRIS due to preexisting CMV retinitis may develop extensive vitritis, papillitis, cataracts, epiretinal membrane formation, and cystoid macular edema. Although visual loss is most commonly due to macular edema, patients may develop proliferative vitreoretinopathy, spontaneous vitreal hemorrhage, and vitreomacular traction leading to retinal detachment. Fundoscopic examination of such patients reveals an intense inflammatory reaction far beyond that usually seen with CMV retinitis (which usually manifests as necrosis of the retina with minimal intraocular inflammation) [88]. Despite treatment efforts, a significant proportion of patients with IRU may develop a chronic inflammatory condition resulting in significant visual complications lasting for months or years [89]. Although CMV-associated IRIS usually manifests as IRU or worsening retinitis, preexisting CMV infection may rarely result in IRIS manifesting as pneumonitis [90], colitis, pancreatitis, or submandibular inflammation [91]. Some cases of CMV-associated IRIS have occurred in HIV-infected patients with absolute CD4 counts above 100 cells/microL, a remarkable finding in contrast to that seen in HIV-infected patients during the era prior to the introduction of potent ART, when <1 percent of patients with CD4 counts above 100 cells/microL developed symptoms attributable to CMV infection [92]. IRIS due to preexisting infection with JC virus — HIV-infected patients co-infected with JC virus may develop progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) after CD4 cell counts drop below 200/microL. (See ""Overview of JC polyomavirus, BK polyomavirus, and other polyomavirus infections"".) Although some HIV-infected patients with PML improve following the initiation of ART, about 10 to 20 percent of patients may develop new or worsening neurologic symptoms associated with enlarging CNS lesions that show secondary enhancement after infusion of contrast agents (a finding not typically present in AIDS patients with PML) [93-95]. It can be challenging clinically to distinguish PML disease progression from PML IRIS. (See ""Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"", section on 'Inflammatory PML'.) Most cases of IRIS associated with JC virus infections occur three to six weeks after ART is begun [93]. Biopsy in such cases reveals extensive demyelination and surrounding inflammation [96,97]. Patients may experience clinical improvement or stabilization after three to six months of continued ART, but IRIS associated with JC virus may directly or indirectly result in a fatal outcome despite an excellent virologic response to ART [93,94,97,98]. The role of empiric corticosteroids and other adjunctive therapies remains controversial. (See ""Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: Treatment and prognosis"", section on 'Inflammatory PML'.) IRIS associated with Pneumocystis jirovecii infection — Many HIV-infected patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) develop a paradoxical inflammatory response following the initiation of antimicrobial therapy directed against Pneumocystis. For this reason adjunctive corticosteroids are routinely used in patients with moderate to severe disease. (See ""Treatment and prevention of Pneumocystis infection in HIV-infected patients"".) IRIS associated with P.jirovecii infection in patients with advanced HIV infection results in similar symptoms as the infection itself. IRIS can be suspected when the onset correlates more closely with ART initiation than with treatment for PCP. One to three weeks after initiating ART, some patients who were previously treated with both antipneumocystis therapy and corticosteroids and responded well go on to develop IRIS manifesting as recurrent fever, increased cough, chest discomfort, dyspnea, hypoxia, and progressive radiographic pulmonary opacification. Repeat bronchoscopy may reveal large numbers of inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [99-101]. IRIS associated with herpes zoster — A study that compared the incidence of symptomatic varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection in HIV-infected patients with and without concurrent antiretroviral therapy found that symptomatic herpes zoster occurred two to nine times as often in HIV-infected patients treated with ART as compared to HIV-infected patients who did not receive ART. Almost all such cases are limited to a localized dermatomal distribution and respond well to oral acyclovir or famciclovir. Some patients with preexisting ocular infection with VZV develop striking keratitis and/or iritis within the first one to four months following the initiation of ART [102]. IRIS associated with hepatitis B and C — Coinfection with HIV alters the natural history of patients with hepatitis B and C virus infections even in the absence of treatment for HIV. (See ""Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of hepatitis B in the HIV-infected patient"" and ""Epidemiology, natural history, and diagnosis of hepatitis C in the HIV-infected patient"".) Symptoms and laboratory abnormalities suggesting worsening hepatitis may occur in patients coinfected with HCV or HBV following ART [103-107]. Affected patients typically have elevated serum liver enzymes accompanied by fevers, night sweats, anorexia, nausea, fatigue, tender hepatomegaly, and jaundice. Some patients have developed symmetric inflammatory polyarthralgias, sometimes associated with mixed cryoglobulinemia [108], while others have developed porphyria cutanea tarda [105]. IRIS associated with hepatitis viruses B and C usually occurs within two to eight weeks of initiation of ART but onset may be delayed for up to nine months. The incidence of clinical hepatitis among ART responders who are coinfected with HBV or HCV is estimated to be 1 to 5 percent. Because elevated liver enzymes in coinfected patients treated with ART can be due to a variety of causes such as hepatotoxic drug effects (as can be seen with protease inhibitors or nevirapine), drug-induced lactic acidosis, withdrawal of antiviral therapy in a patient with underlying HBV, Kaposi sarcoma, or other infectious causes such as new infection with other hepatotrophic viruses, it is often difficult to establish a definitive diagnosis of IRIS. However, in cases of presumed IRIS due to preexisting hepatitis B or C viruses, patients undergoing liver biopsy show dramatic liver necrosis and inflammatory activity with markedly increased CD8+ T cell infiltration in the absence of microbiological evidence of infection with other infectious agents that cause hepatic injury [103,107]. In a few cases, patients with symptomatic hepatitis due to IRIS related to HCV or HBV infection underwent documented virus-specific seroconversion.","The mechanism underlying paradoxical reactions appears to be mediated by the immune system, although it is not fully understood.",Patients coinfected with HIV and TB do not experience higher rates of paradoxical reactions compared to those without HIV.,"While some patients with preexisting cryptococcal infections may develop IRIS symptoms, the timing and severity of these reactions can vary significantly."

Rarely, patients with disseminated cryptococcal infections may develop mediastinal lymphadenitis, hypercalcemia, and cutaneous abscesses as part of the IRIS syndrome [83,84]. IRIS associated with cytomegalovirus — IRIS due to prior cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection has been termed ""immune recovery uveitis"" (IRU) or ""immune recovery vitritis"" by various investigators [85,86]. IRIS has been reported in 16 to 63 percent of HIV-infected patients with CMV retinitis following the initiation of ART [29,86,87]. In one study the median time to IRU following ART initiation was 43 weeks, but onset can occur as early as four weeks or as late as four years in some patients [85,86]. (See ""Treatment of AIDS-related cytomegalovirus retinitis"", section on 'CMV immune reconstitution inflammatory syndromes'.) IRU may manifest with some or all of the following: painless floaters, blurred vision, photopia (the sensation of flashing lights), decreased visual acuity, or ocular pain. Patients with IRIS due to preexisting CMV retinitis may develop extensive vitritis, papillitis, cataracts, epiretinal membrane formation, and cystoid macular edema. Although visual loss is most commonly due to macular edema, patients may develop proliferative vitreoretinopathy, spontaneous vitreal hemorrhage, and vitreomacular traction leading to retinal detachment. Fundoscopic examination of such patients reveals an intense inflammatory reaction far beyond that usually seen with CMV retinitis (which usually manifests as necrosis of the retina with minimal intraocular inflammation) [88]. Despite treatment efforts, a significant proportion of patients with IRU may develop a chronic inflammatory condition resulting in significant visual complications lasting for months or years [89]. Although CMV-associated IRIS usually manifests as IRU or worsening retinitis, preexisting CMV infection may rarely result in IRIS manifesting as pneumonitis [90], colitis, pancreatitis, or submandibular inflammation [91]. Some cases of CMV-associated IRIS have occurred in HIV-infected patients with absolute CD4 counts above 100 cells/microL, a remarkable finding in contrast to that seen in HIV-infected patients during the era prior to the introduction of potent ART, when <1 percent of patients with CD4 counts above 100 cells/microL developed symptoms attributable to CMV infection [92]. IRIS due to preexisting infection with JC virus — HIV-infected patients co-infected with JC virus may develop progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) after CD4 cell counts drop below 200/microL. (See ""Overview of JC polyomavirus, BK polyomavirus, and other polyomavirus infections"".) Although some HIV-infected patients with PML improve following the initiation of ART, about 10 to 20 percent of patients may develop new or worsening neurologic symptoms associated with enlarging CNS lesions that show secondary enhancement after infusion of contrast agents (a finding not typically present in AIDS patients with PML) [93-95]. It can be challenging clinically to distinguish PML disease progression from PML IRIS. (See ""Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis"", section on 'Inflammatory PML'.) Most cases of IRIS associated with JC virus infections occur three to six weeks after ART is begun [93]. Biopsy in such cases reveals extensive demyelination and surrounding inflammation [96,97]. Patients may experience clinical improvement or stabilization after three to six months of continued ART, but IRIS associated with JC virus may directly or indirectly result in a fatal outcome despite an excellent virologic response to ART [93,94,97,98]. The role of empiric corticosteroids and other adjunctive therapies remains controversial. (See ""Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy: Treatment and prognosis"", section on 'Inflammatory PML'.) IRIS associated with Pneumocystis jirovecii infection — Many HIV-infected patients with Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) develop a paradoxical inflammatory response following the initiation of antimicrobial therapy directed against Pneumocystis. For this reason adjunctive corticosteroids are routinely used in patients with moderate to severe disease. (See ""Treatment and prevention of Pneumocystis infection in HIV-infected patients"".) IRIS associated with P.jirovecii infection in patients with advanced HIV infection results in similar symptoms as the infection itself. IRIS can be suspected when the onset correlates more closely with ART initiation than with treatment for PCP. One to three weeks after initiating ART, some patients who were previously treated with both antipneumocystis therapy and corticosteroids and responded well go on to develop IRIS manifesting as recurrent fever, increased cough, chest discomfort, dyspnea, hypoxia, and progressive radiographic pulmonary opacification. Repeat bronchoscopy may reveal large numbers of inflammatory cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [99-101]. IRIS associated with herpes zoster — A study that compared the incidence of symptomatic varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection in HIV-infected patients with and without concurrent antiretroviral therapy found that symptomatic herpes zoster occurred two to nine times as often in HIV-infected patients treated with ART as compared to HIV-infected patients who did not receive ART. Almost all such cases are limited to a localized dermatomal distribution and respond well to oral acyclovir or famciclovir. Some patients with preexisting ocular infection with VZV develop striking keratitis and/or iritis within the first one to four months following the initiation of ART [102]. IRIS associated with hepatitis B and C — Coinfection with HIV alters the natural history of patients with hepatitis B and C virus infections even in the absence of treatment for HIV. (See ""Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of hepatitis B in the HIV-infected patient"" and ""Epidemiology, natural history, and diagnosis of hepatitis C in the HIV-infected patient"".) Symptoms and laboratory abnormalities suggesting worsening hepatitis may occur in patients coinfected with HCV or HBV following ART [103-107]. Affected patients typically have elevated serum liver enzymes accompanied by fevers, night sweats, anorexia, nausea, fatigue, tender hepatomegaly, and jaundice. Some patients have developed symmetric inflammatory polyarthralgias, sometimes associated with mixed cryoglobulinemia [108], while others have developed porphyria cutanea tarda [105]. IRIS associated with hepatitis viruses B and C usually occurs within two to eight weeks of initiation of ART but onset may be delayed for up to nine months. The incidence of clinical hepatitis among ART responders who are coinfected with HBV or HCV is estimated to be 1 to 5 percent. Because elevated liver enzymes in coinfected patients treated with ART can be due to a variety of causes such as hepatotoxic drug effects (as can be seen with protease inhibitors or nevirapine), drug-induced lactic acidosis, withdrawal of antiviral therapy in a patient with underlying HBV, Kaposi sarcoma, or other infectious causes such as new infection with other hepatotrophic viruses, it is often difficult to establish a definitive diagnosis of IRIS. However, in cases of presumed IRIS due to preexisting hepatitis B or C viruses, patients undergoing liver biopsy show dramatic liver necrosis and inflammatory activity with markedly increased CD8+ T cell infiltration in the absence of microbiological evidence of infection with other infectious agents that cause hepatic injury [103,107]. In a few cases, patients with symptomatic hepatitis due to IRIS related to HCV or HBV infection underwent documented virus-specific seroconversion.",Patients with HIV who are also infected with M. avium complex frequently develop inflammatory reactions after starting antiretroviral therapy.,There is no evidence to suggest that patients with HIV and CMV infection experience any inflammatory reactions following ART initiation.,"Although the severity of symptoms associated with IRIS can be significant, it is uncertain whether all patients will experience marked clinical deterioration."
./UTD2txt/8711.txt,"The mechanism for paradoxical reactions is not well understood, but it appears to be immune mediated. Changes in the ability to respond to tuberculin proteins occur in some patients following the initiation of antituberculous therapy. For example, in one study, 74 percent of patients who were initially anergic had reversion of their previously negative tuberculin skin tests within two weeks of starting antituberculous therapy [56]. The incidence of paradoxical reactions in HIV-uninfected patients may be higher in patients who develop TB while receiving the immunomodulator infliximab [13]. (See ""Tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors and mycobacterial infections"".) The incidence of paradoxical worsening associated with pulmonary TB is higher in HIV-infected individuals following ART initiation compared with those who are not coinfected with HIV [57-59]. As an example, in a prospective study paradoxical inflammatory reactions were documented in 12 of 33 patients (36 percent) coinfected with HIV and treated with ART, but similar reactions occurred in only 1 of 55 patients (2 percent) without HIV [60]. A retrospective review found severe transient worsening of chest radiograph appearance in 7 of 31 patients (23 percent) who were coinfected with HIV and TB and treated for both, and in 2 of 56 patients (4 percent; 26 patients with HIV coinfection and 30 patients without HIV) who were only receiving therapy for TB [61]. In a retrospective cohort of 144 HIV patients with TB coinfection, 11 (8 percent) had a paradoxical reaction after a median time of 47 days following ART initiation and an incidence rate of 15 cases per 100 patient-years [62]. Patients who are coinfected with TB and HIV may also develop IRIS that manifests as tuberculous lymphadenitis [63], cutaneous lesions [60], peritonitis [64], epididymitis [64], bowel perforation [65], or granulomatous nephritis [66]. The time interval from initiation of ART to the onset of IRIS associated with TB has varied from 10 to 180 days [3], but tends to occur within the first 60 days of starting ART therapy [6,67]. Mycobacterium avium complex — Patients coinfected with HIV and M.avium complex (MAC) may develop inflammatory reactions following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy ( and image 1 and ) [68-71]. IRIS due to MAC often manifests as fever and painful lymphadenitis that occurs one to eight weeks after ART is commenced [3,70-72]. The majority of patients with IRIS due to treated MAC infection have negative blood and bone marrow cultures. In contrast to findings in patients with AIDS and untreated MAC infection, biopsies of lymph nodes of patients with IRIS secondary to MAC can reveal well-formed granulomas with relatively few visible organisms [73]. (See ""Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections in HIV-infected patients"", section on 'Lymphadenitis'.) Individual case reports or small case series also exist describing IRIS syndrome manifesting as necrotic subcutaneous nodules, osteomyelitis, bursitis [1], granulomatous hepatitis, paravertebral abscesses [3], brain abscess [74], worsening lung infiltrates, or diffuse intestinal involvement presenting with abdominal pain [75]. (See ""Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections in HIV-infected patients"", section on 'Uncommon manifestations'.) IRIS associated with preexisting cryptococcal infection — HIV-infected patients previously infected with Cryptococcus spp.may develop symptoms of IRIS localized to the central nervous system (CNS) or the lungs [76]. Symptoms often occur within two months after commencement of therapy, but may be delayed for more than six months [76-78]. Despite the use of concurrent antifungal therapy, patients with preexisting cryptococcal meningoencephalitis may develop fever, increased headache, nausea, eye pain, photophobia, and nuchal rigidity following the initiation of ART [79]. (See ""Clinical management and monitoring during antifungal therapy of the HIV-infected patient with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis"", section on 'Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome'.) At the time of initial cryptococcal meningoencephalitis diagnosis, a paucity of CSF inflammation (eg, WBC <25 cells/microL) have been associated with development of IRIS [80]. Conversely, follow-up lumbar puncture in patients with IRIS associated with cryptococcal meningitis often reveals more inflammatory cells than were found prior to the initiation of antifungal therapy and ART; however, cultures usually remain sterile. One retrospective study found that compared with classic forms of AIDS-related cryptococcal meningitis, patients with IRIS-related cryptococcal meningitis had significantly higher opening pressures, CSF WBC counts (56 versus 12 cells/microL), CD4 cell counts, and lower HIV viral loads [81,82]. HIV-infected patients with preexisting cryptococcal pulmonary infection may develop cavitary lung lesions, hypoxia, respiratory failure, and ARDS following the initiation of ART [3,83].

When stored serum (which was drawn one to two years prior to ART initiation) was retrospectively tested for HCV by PCR, it revealed detectable levels of HCV RNA, indicating prior subclinical infection [105]. In at least one case of IRIS associated with a known chronic HBV carrier, hepatitis B core antibody and hepatitis B e antibody titers significantly increased and hepatitis B e antigen was cleared from the serum [103].

./UTD2txt/8077.txt,"Hematospermia may be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer in older men. In a community-based screening study involving 26,126 men ages 50 or older (or ages 40 or older if black or with a family history of prostate cancer), men were screened for prostate cancer every 6 or 12 months with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and DRE and underwent biopsy, if these results were abnormal [45]. On an initial questionnaire, 187 men (0.7 percent) reported a history of hematospermia. Over the course of the study, prostate cancer was detected more commonly in men with than without hematospermia (13.7 versus 6.5 percent). No cases of prostate cancer were found in the 15 men with hematospermia who were younger than age 50. The interval between hematospermia and prostate cancer, as well as the duration of hematospermia, could not be assessed in this study. Also, it is unclear whether the history of hematospermia could have been known to the examiner performing the DRE and thus could have resulted in more aggressive evaluation for prostate cancer (detection bias); however, the authors of the paper report that they do not believe the examiners had this information [46]. The major conclusions drawn from these and other studies are that hematospermia is almost always caused by a benign condition in younger men and, in many cases, no clear cause can be identified. In older men with hematospermia, genitourinary cancers should be considered in the differential diagnosis, but the rate of such cancers is low, even after long-term follow-up. EVALUATION — The etiology of hematospermia is almost always a benign condition. For patients who are otherwise asymptomatic, the initial evaluation consists of a history, physical examination, and urinalysis. Other studies are indicated only if abnormalities are suggested by these initial measures or if hematospermia persists. Although many experts recommend a more aggressive evaluation for even a single episode of hematospermia in a man over age 50, we do not believe existing evidence supports the need for this. Men with hematospermia and symptoms of urethritis should be tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia. Persistent unexplained hematospermia (lasting longer than one month) should be evaluated with transrectal ultrasonography and, in men over age 50, with referral to a urologist. History — The history is usually unrevealing unless the patient has an obvious history of dysuria (suggesting infection), urological symptoms suggesting prostate disease, or known urological malignancy. The clinician should ask patients about these conditions, although they are not often present. The patient’s medication list should be evaluated for agents that have been associated with hematospermia (eg, antiplatelet drugs, finasteride) [47,48]. Questions should also be asked to assure that the patient has not recently had a biopsy of the prostate gland or vasectomy because, as mentioned, hematospermia is a well-known complication of these procedures. Travel history should be reviewed to determine if the patient has visited an area that is endemic for schistosomiasis, as there are multiple case reports of hematospermia due to this infection [9,10,49-51]. (See ""Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of schistosomiasis"".) Physical examination — While the physical examination is typically normal among patients with hematospermia, examination should focus on identifying organ enlargement or masses in the scrotum, or nodularity or enlargement of the prostate gland. Urinalysis and urine culture — A urinalysis should be performed on all patients with hematospermia to exclude infection; bacterial culture should be obtained as indicated by the results of the urinalysis. Pyuria without bacteriuria may be a clue to chlamydial infection, one of the reported (though uncommon) causes of hematospermia [11,52]. (See ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infections"" and ""Treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection"".) Men with hematospermia and symptoms of urethritis should be tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea. If these tests are negative but symptoms of urethritis persist, infection with other agents such as trichomonas should be considered. The diagnosis of trichomonas in men is difficult and may require specimens from multiple sites (eg, urine, urethra, semen). (See ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection in adults and adolescents"" and ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infections"" and ""Treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection"".) In men with hematospermia who are otherwise asymptomatic, we suggest not routinely testing for sexually transmitted infections. In men at very high risk for sexually transmitted infections, routine screening for gonorrhea and chlamydia is recommended even in the absence of hematospermia and so would be appropriate. (See ""Screening for sexually transmitted infections"".) Semen examination — Examination of the semen is not a routine part of the evaluation of patients with hematospermia. There are, however, several situations in which semen examination can be helpful. The first is when there is doubt about whether the patient actually has hematospermia. In this situation, the patient can ejaculate into a condom and the ejaculate can be examined for the presence of blood. A second situation in which semen evaluation may be helpful is when the patient has a history of travel to an area in which schistosomiasis is endemic. In these cases, microscopic examination of the semen can detect Schistosoma haematobium or S.mansoni. Semen microscopy is not a useful test if there is no such travel history. At least one case report suggests that melanospermia can be confused with hematospermia. Melanospermia occurs when malignant melanoma, metastatic to the seminal vesicles, causes pigmentation of the semen (although melanoma can also cause true hematospermia) [53]. While this diagnosis is quite rare, melanospermia can be distinguished from hematospermia by subjecting the semen specimen to gas chromatography. Blood tests — Routine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is not necessary in men with hematospermia. Some studies do suggest that men over age 50 with a history of hematospermia are at a slightly higher long-term risk of prostate cancer, so it is reasonable to take this into account when making decisions about screening for prostate cancer. (See ""Screening for prostate cancer"".) Imaging — When imaging is required, transrectal ultrasound is the imaging procedure of choice for patients with hematospermia [6,7,54,55]. It can identify structural abnormalities of the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and spermatic cord, and guide biopsies if any suspicious abnormalities are identified in those organs. Transrectal ultrasound should be obtained when hematospermia persists for more than one month. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly endorectal coil MRI, is a second-line imaging test that may occasionally be helpful when transrectal ultrasound is technically inadequate or nondiagnostic [12,56]. However, some studies suggest that MRI for the evaluation of hematospermia leads to a higher rate of prostate biopsies with no change in the cancer detection rate [57]. (See ""The role of magnetic resonance imaging in prostate cancer"".) Other studies — Based on the results of the tests discussed above, other studies may be occasionally indicated in selected cases. These include cystoscopy, contrast studies (eg, vasography), or biopsies of the prostate, testes, or other organs. We suggest referring men over age 50 with hematospermia lasting more than one month to a urologist. TREATMENT — In most cases, the evaluation described above will not identify a clear cause of hematospermia. Thus, there is no specific treatment for the majority of patients, and the condition usually resolves spontaneously.","Hemat spermia is often linked to benign conditions in younger men, and in older men, it should prompt consideration of genitourinary cancers, though the overall cancer rate remains low.","The study found prostate cancer was equally common in men with and without hematospermia, indicating no increased risk.","While many experts suggest aggressive evaluation for hematospermia in men over 50, the evidence does not definitively support this approach."

Beers Criteria: Based on pharmacologic class concerns for antipsychotics in the Beers Criteria, flupentixol may be a potentially inappropriate medication to be avoided in patients 65 years and older with dementia due to an increased risk of mortality, cerebrovascular accidents (stroke), and a greater rate of cognitive decline with use; avoid antipsychotics for behavioral problems associated with dementia or delirium unless alternative nonpharmacologic therapies have failed and patient may harm self or others. Use may be appropriate in geriatric patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or for short-term use as an antiemetic during chemotherapy. In addition, antipsychotics should be used with caution in older adults due to their potential to cause or exacerbate syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) or hyponatremia; monitor sodium closely with initiation or dosage adjustments in older adults (Beers Criteria [AGS 2015]).

Due to similarities in chemical structure and/or pharmacologic actions the possibility of cross-sensitivity between thioxanthenes and phenothiazine derivatives should be considered. Warnings/Precautions
Concerns related to adverse effects:
• Altered cardiac conduction: May alter cardiac conduction; life-threatening arrhythmias have occurred with therapeutic doses of antipsychotics Haddad 2002; Stollberger 2005). Use with caution in susceptible patients (eg, significant bradycardia, recent MI, decompensated HF, arrhythmias). Correct electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia prior to use. Avoid use in patients with underlying QT prolongation, in those taking medicines that prolong the QT interval, or cause polymorphic ventricular tachycardia; monitor ECG closely for dose-related QT effects. Adverse effects of decanoate may be prolonged. • Anticholinergic effects: May cause anticholinergic effects (constipation, xerostomia, blurred vision, urinary retention); use with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility, paralytic ileus, urinary retention, BPH, xerostomia, or visual problems. Relative to other neuroleptics, flupentixol has a low potency of cholinergic blockade. • Blood dyscrasias: Antipsychotic use has been associated with agranulocytosis, neutropenia, leukopenia, and granulocytopenia; monitoring of CBC is recommended. • CNS effects: May be sedating in some patients (flupentixol is associated with less sedative effects compared to other antipsychotics), use with caution in disorders where CNS depression is a feature; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks which require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery or driving). • Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): DKA has been observed in patients with no prior history of hyperglycemia; monitoring of blood glucose and body weight is recommended. • Esophageal dysmotility/aspiration: Antipsychotic use has been associated with esophageal dysmotility and aspiration; use with caution in patients at risk of pneumonia (ie, Alzheimer's disease) (Maddalena 2004). • Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS): May cause extrapyramidal symptoms, including pseudoparkinsonism, acute dystonic reactions, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia. Risk of dystonia (and possibly other EPS) may be greater with increased doses, use of conventional antipsychotics, males, and younger patients. Factors associated with greater vulnerability to tardive dyskinesia include older in age, female gender combined with postmenopausal status, Parkinson disease, pseudoparkinsonism symptoms, affective disorders (particularly major depressive disorder), concurrent medical diseases such as diabetes, previous brain damage, alcoholism, poor treatment response, and use of high doses of antipsychotics (APA [Lehman 2004]; Soares-Weiser 2007).

Beers Criteria: Based on pharmacologic class concerns for antipsychotics in the Beers Criteria, flupentixol may be a potentially inappropriate medication to be avoided in patients 65 years and older with dementia due to an increased risk of mortality, cerebrovascular accidents (stroke), and a greater rate of cognitive decline with use; avoid antipsychotics for behavioral problems associated with dementia or delirium unless alternative nonpharmacologic therapies have failed and patient may harm self or others. Use may be appropriate in geriatric patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or for short-term use as an antiemetic during chemotherapy. In addition, antipsychotics should be used with caution in older adults due to their potential to cause or exacerbate syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) or hyponatremia; monitor sodium closely with initiation or dosage adjustments in older adults (Beers Criteria [AGS 2015]).

Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to flupentixol, thioxanthenes, or any component of the formulation; acute intoxication (ethanol, barbiturate, or opioid); CNS depression due to any cause; coma; severely-agitated psychotic patients, psychoneurotic patients, or geriatric patients with confusion and/or agitation; suspected or established subcortical brain damage; cerebrovascular or renal insufficiency; severe cardiovascular disease/circulatory collapse; liver damage; concomitant use with large doses of hypnotics
Due to similarities in chemical structure and/or pharmacologic actions the possibility of cross-sensitivity between thioxanthenes and phenothiazine derivatives should be considered. Warnings/Precautions
Concerns related to adverse effects:
• Altered cardiac conduction: May alter cardiac conduction; life-threatening arrhythmias have occurred with therapeutic doses of antipsychotics Haddad 2002; Stollberger 2005). Use with caution in susceptible patients (eg, significant bradycardia, recent MI, decompensated HF, arrhythmias). Correct electrolyte abnormalities (eg, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia prior to use. Avoid use in patients with underlying QT prolongation, in those taking medicines that prolong the QT interval, or cause polymorphic ventricular tachycardia; monitor ECG closely for dose-related QT effects. Adverse effects of decanoate may be prolonged. • Anticholinergic effects: May cause anticholinergic effects (constipation, xerostomia, blurred vision, urinary retention); use with caution in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility, paralytic ileus, urinary retention, BPH, xerostomia, or visual problems. Relative to other neuroleptics, flupentixol has a low potency of cholinergic blockade. • Blood dyscrasias: Antipsychotic use has been associated with agranulocytosis, neutropenia, leukopenia, and granulocytopenia; monitoring of CBC is recommended. • CNS effects: May be sedating in some patients (flupentixol is associated with less sedative effects compared to other antipsychotics), use with caution in disorders where CNS depression is a feature; patients must be cautioned about performing tasks which require mental alertness (eg, operating machinery or driving). • Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): DKA has been observed in patients with no prior history of hyperglycemia; monitoring of blood glucose and body weight is recommended. • Esophageal dysmotility/aspiration: Antipsychotic use has been associated with esophageal dysmotility and aspiration; use with caution in patients at risk of pneumonia (ie, Alzheimer's disease) (Maddalena 2004). • Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS): May cause extrapyramidal symptoms, including pseudoparkinsonism, acute dystonic reactions, akathisia, and tardive dyskinesia. Risk of dystonia (and possibly other EPS) may be greater with increased doses, use of conventional antipsychotics, males, and younger patients. Factors associated with greater vulnerability to tardive dyskinesia include older in age, female gender combined with postmenopausal status, Parkinson disease, pseudoparkinsonism symptoms, affective disorders (particularly major depressive disorder), concurrent medical diseases such as diabetes, previous brain damage, alcoholism, poor treatment response, and use of high doses of antipsychotics (APA [Lehman 2004]; Soares-Weiser 2007).

What is meningitis? — Meningitis is a condition that can cause a fever, headache, and stiff neck. It happens when the lining that covers the brain and spinal cord (called the ""meninges"") gets inflamed or infected.

Both types of meningitis can cause similar symptoms. It is very important that doctors  what kind of meningitis a person has. That's because bacterial meningitis is a medical emergency. If it is not treated quickly, it can lead to brain problems such as hearing loss or learning problems. It can also lead to death. This article discusses bacterial meningitis. What are the symptoms of bacterial meningitis? — Symptoms of bacterial meningitis usually come on suddenly, so people can get very sick over a short period of time. Common symptoms include:
● Fever – But some people have a temperature that is lower than normal instead of a fever. ● Headache
● Stiff neck – This happens most often in adults and children. Babies might not get a stiff neck. ● Nausea or vomiting
● Acting confused, or being hard to wake up
● Having light bother a person's eyes
● A rash that looks like red or purple spots on the skin that do not go away when touched
● Seizures – Seizures are waves of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They can make people pass out, or move or behave strangely. Babies can also have other symptoms, including:
● Being more sleepy or fussy than usual
● Not feeding well
● A bulging soft spot on the skull

Small lymphatic capillaries drain organs and merge into larger vessels that eventually drain into lymph nodes. The ultimate destination of this drainage and filtration system is the thoracic duct, which empties into the venous system. Malignant tumor can invade the lymphatic endothelium, creating emboli that may be transported to regional or distant lymph nodes [6]. The lymph nodes of interest in a pelvic and paraaortic dissection lie along, upon, or in between the great vessels of the pelvis and abdomen . Lymph nodes are divided into regions based upon arbitrary anatomic boundaries for the purpose of staging of cancers and for defining the boundaries of surgical dissection. Lymphatic drainage from the pelvic viscera may proceed in a step-wise fashion from the pelvic to the lower and then upper aortic lymph nodes; however, lymphatic channels from the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus may also drain directly into the lower and upper paraaortic nodes. Pelvic lymph nodes — The pelvic lymph nodes include the lower portion of the common iliac, external and internal iliac, obturator, sacral, and pararectal nodes . It is uncommon for the sacral and pararectal nodes to be included in a lymph node dissection for a gynecologic malignancy. According to the Gynecologic Oncology Group Surgical Procedures Manual, pelvic node dissection includes bilateral removal of nodal tissue from the distal one-half of each common iliac artery, the anterior and medial aspect of the proximal half of the external iliac artery and vein, and the distal half of the obturator fat pad anterior to the obturator nerve [7]. Most of the pelvic lymph nodes lie anterior, medially, and posteriorly to the external and internal iliac vessels and the obturator nerve. There are a few nodes that lie lateral to these structures, between the vessels and the pelvic sidewall, and these are generally removed in a complete dissection [8]. Paraaortic lymph nodes — According to the Gynecologic Oncology Group Surgical Procedures Manual, paraaortic node dissection consists of resection of nodal tissue over the distal vena cava from the level of the inferior mesenteric artery to the mid right common iliac artery and between the aorta and the left ureter from the inferior mesenteric artery to the left mid common iliac artery  [7]. By convention, many staging protocols limit the superior extent of dissection for gynecologic malignancies to the level of the inferior mesenteric artery. However, uterine fundal, fallopian tube, and ovarian lymphatics can drain directly to the paraaortic nodes above the level of the inferior mesenteric artery. The lymphatic drainage from pelvic viscera to the paraaortic nodes is complex and involves both ipsilateral and contralateral connections in addition to direct lymphatic channels that may bypass the pelvic drainage basin. It is not uncommon for the surgeon to encounter anatomic vascular anomalies of the arteries and veins during a paraaortic lymphadenectomy. Accessory renal arteries are likely the most common arterial anomaly, and many types of venous abnormalities exist [9-11]. Extent of lymph node evaluation — A lymph node dissection (also referred to as lymphadenectomy) is intended to clear all lymph nodes from a specified area defined by anatomic boundaries and is the most accurate technique for defining the surgical stage in a patient with a gynecologic malignancy. Selective or random sampling of nodes from the pelvis and/or the paraaortic region has been described and is less thorough or complete compared with a lymph node dissection (lymphadenectomy). If selective node sampling is performed, nodes are typically visualized and palpated and sampled if they are suspicious for metastatic disease (eg, enlarged to >1 cm, rounded instead of oval, hard, fall apart when dissected). Selective or random sampling is generally of little value except when performed as part of a formal sentinel node identification procedure. In the staging of gynecologic cancers, the extent of lymphadenectomy varies by type of cancer and node chain (pelvic or paraaortic). The approach to evaluation of lymph nodes for each tumor site is discussed in detail separately.

Cervical cancer — Cervical cancer is clinically staged based upon physical examination, biopsy, endoscopy (eg, cystoscopy), and plain film radiographs . Evaluation for pelvic and paraaortic lymph node metastases impacts prognosis and treatment decisions, but is not part of clinical staging. Thus, pelvic and/or paraaortic lymph node dissection is regularly incorporated into the management of patients with early-stage disease and in selected patients with locally advanced-stage disease [2,12]. In early-stage cervical cancer, information regarding lymph node involvement helps to guide whether the primary therapy will be radical hysterectomy or chemoradiation, and if adjuvant chemoradiation should be given. In addition, the information impacts the anatomic level chosen for volume-directed radiation therapy in both early- and advanced-stage disease. It is controversial whether debulking grossly enlarged positive lymph nodes is therapeutic in cervical cancer [2-4], but some centers routinely remove bulky nodes in women with advanced cervical cancer prior to definitive treatment with radiation and concurrent chemotherapy.

Selective or random sampling is generally of little value except when performed as part of a formal sentinel node identification procedure. In the staging of gynecologic cancers, the extent of lymphadenectomy varies by type of cancer and node chain (pelvic or paraaortic). The approach to evaluation of lymph nodes for each tumor site is discussed in detail separately. (See ""Invasive cervical cancer: Staging and evaluation of lymph nodes"" and ""Endometrial carcinoma: Pretreatment evaluation, staging, and surgical treatment"" and ""Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Staging and initial surgical management"".) TUMOR SITES — The use of pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy in gynecologic malignancies is summarized here briefly. The evaluation of lymph node status for each tumor site is discussed in detail separately. (See ""Invasive cervical cancer: Staging and evaluation of lymph nodes"" and ""Endometrial carcinoma: Pretreatment evaluation, staging, and surgical treatment"" and ""Cancer of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Staging and initial surgical management"".) Cervical cancer — Cervical cancer is clinically staged based upon physical examination, biopsy, endoscopy (eg, cystoscopy), and plain film radiographs . Evaluation for pelvic and paraaortic lymph node metastases impacts prognosis and treatment decisions, but is not part of clinical staging. Thus, pelvic and/or paraaortic lymph node dissection is regularly incorporated into the management of patients with early-stage disease and in selected patients with locally advanced-stage disease [2,12]. In early-stage cervical cancer, information regarding lymph node involvement helps to guide whether the primary therapy will be radical hysterectomy or chemoradiation, and if adjuvant chemoradiation should be given. In addition, the information impacts the anatomic level chosen for volume-directed radiation therapy in both early- and advanced-stage disease. It is controversial whether debulking grossly enlarged positive lymph nodes is therapeutic in cervical cancer [2-4], but some centers routinely remove bulky nodes in women with advanced cervical cancer prior to definitive treatment with radiation and concurrent chemotherapy. Lymph node evaluation in cervical cancer is discussed in detail separately. (See ""Invasive cervical cancer: Staging and evaluation of lymph nodes"", section on 'Surgical evaluation of lymph nodes' and ""Management of early-stage cervical cancer"", section on 'Approach to treatment' and ""Management of locally advanced cervical cancer"", section on 'Treatment of para-aortic nodes'.) Endometrial cancer — Endometrial cancer is surgically staged . One of the most important prognostic factors for endometrial carcinoma is the presence of extrauterine disease, particularly pelvic and paraaortic lymph node metastases. Evaluation of pelvic and paraaortic lymph nodes is required as part of staging, but there is ongoing controversy about the mode of evaluation, particularly in women presumed to have early-stage disease.",The thoracic duct serves as the final destination for lymphatic drainage and filtration in the body.,"Lymphatic channels from the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus do not drain into the lower and upper paraaortic nodes.",The complexity of lymphatic drainage pathways suggests there may be exceptions to conventional methods of staging and dissecting lymph nodes.

Briefly, a small incision is made in the left flank of the mid abdomen.",Developing the area between the obliterated umbilical artery and external iliac vessels helps expose critical spaces for dissection.,The circumflex iliac vein is not typically visualized during the dissection process.,"The choice between transperitoneal and extraperitoneal approaches for paraaortic lymphadenectomy may influence patient outcomes, but definitive evidence is lacking."

./UTD2txt/13272.txt,"A few centers are performing SLN outside research protocols; however, comparisons of cost effectiveness, complications, and overall survival between women who have had SLN versus traditional lymphadenectomy or lymph node sampling have not been completed. The rationale for SLN mapping is to identify patients with lymph node metastases and avoid the morbidity of a full lymphadenectomy in patients with negative SLNs. In addition, SLN mapping may also be considered a technique that may identify occult metastatic disease not otherwise identified by a standard lymphadenectomy. This may occur if the node lies outside of the usual boundaries of pelvic or paraaortic lymph node dissection. Also, the SLN evaluation process typically includes ultra-section of the SLN and immunohistochemical staining, which may be more sensitive than the traditional hematoxylin and eosin evaluation. The most common technique for identification of sentinel nodes is the injection of vital blue dyes (eg, isosulfan blue) and/or indocyanine green (detectable with near infrared immunofluorescent light) and/or radioisotope (eg, Technetium-99) around the tumor. These techniques are relatively well established for patients diagnosed with vulvar and cervical carcinoma. This injection can be performed intraoperatively with or without preoperative lymphoscintigraphy, and hand-held and laparoscopic instruments (gamma-probe) are available. Sentinel node evaluation for specific gynecologic tumor sites is discussed in detail separately. (See ""Invasive cervical cancer: Staging and evaluation of lymph nodes"", section on 'Sentinel lymph node biopsy' and ""Endometrial carcinoma: Pretreatment evaluation, staging, and surgical treatment"" and ""Squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva: Staging and surgical treatment"", section on 'Sentinel node biopsy'.) POSTOPERATIVE CARE — There are no postoperative management issues unique to the pelvic or paraaortic lymphadenectomy. Patients undergoing pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy are managed based on the type of surgical approach (laparotomy, laparoscopy) and extent of surgery (eg, lymph node dissection alone or full surgical staging) [40,41]. Leaving a drain in place to drain the lymph node dissection basin has fallen out of favor and is not indicated [42]. COMPLICATIONS — Surgical complications in women undergoing a pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection are multifactorial and usually related to the patient age, existing patient comorbidities, surgical approach, operative duration, and concurrent surgical procedures. Laparoscopic procedures in general result in less morbidity than laparotomy, including pain and wound complications [43-45]. The incidence of major organ and vessel injury related to lymphadenectomy is low [46,47]. Women undergoing lymphadenectomy for gynecologic malignancy are at least at a moderate risk of venous thromboembolism. It is not clear that the risk of deep vein thrombosis is higher with or without lymph node dissection. The incidence of thromboembolic disease has been reported in 2 to 5 percent of cases among all women undergoing lymph node dissection for endometrial cancer staging [47-49]. Lymph node drainage issues — Complications related to lymphatic drainage are specific to the lymph node dissection. Lymphedema is the most common complication of pelvic and paraaortic lymphadenectomy, reported in 1.5 to 28 percent of patients. This is likely lower than the actual incidence, since this complication is likely to be underreported in retrospective reports [50,51]. Postoperative irradiation and a greater extent of lymph node dissection increase the risk of this complication.","Some medical centers are conducting SLN procedures outside of research protocols, but comprehensive studies comparing SLN with traditional methods have yet to be performed.",The risk of deep vein thrombosis is definitively higher with lymph node dissection compared to without it.,"While SLN mapping aims to reduce the need for full lymphadenectomy, it is still uncertain how often it successfully identifies metastases that standard methods miss."
./UTD2txt/13272.txt,"A few centers are performing SLN outside research protocols; however, comparisons of cost effectiveness, complications, and overall survival between women who have had SLN versus traditional lymphadenectomy or lymph node sampling have not been completed. The rationale for SLN mapping is to identify patients with lymph node metastases and avoid the morbidity of a full lymphadenectomy in patients with negative SLNs. In addition, SLN mapping may also be considered a technique that may identify occult metastatic disease not otherwise identified by a standard lymphadenectomy. This may occur if the node lies outside of the usual boundaries of pelvic or paraaortic lymph node dissection. Also, the SLN evaluation process typically includes ultra-section of the SLN and immunohistochemical staining, which may be more sensitive than the traditional hematoxylin and eosin evaluation. The most common technique for identification of sentinel nodes is the injection of vital blue dyes (eg, isosulfan blue) and/or indocyanine green (detectable with near infrared immunofluorescent light) and/or radioisotope (eg, Technetium-99) around the tumor. These techniques are relatively well established for patients diagnosed with vulvar and cervical carcinoma. This injection can be performed intraoperatively with or without preoperative lymphoscintigraphy, and hand-held and laparoscopic instruments (gamma-probe) are available.

COMPLICATIONS — Surgical complications in women undergoing a pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection are multifactorial and usually related to the patient age, existing patient comorbidities, surgical approach, operative duration, and concurrent surgical procedures. Laparoscopic procedures in general result in less morbidity than laparotomy, including pain and wound complications [43-45].

● Pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection is a key part of surgical staging for women with cervical, uterine, or ovarian, fallopian tubal, or peritoneal cancers. (See 'Introduction' above.)
● The pelvic lymph nodes include the lower portion of the common iliac, external and internal iliac, obturator, sacral, and pararectal nodes . Pelvic node dissection includes bilateral removal of nodal tissue from the distal one-half of each common iliac artery, the anterior and medial aspect of the proximal half of the external iliac artery and vein, and the distal half of the obturator fat pad anterior to the obturator nerve. (See 'Pelvic lymph nodes' above.)

Can intraventricular hemorrhage in newborns be prevented? — You can reduce the chance that your baby will have an intraventricular hemorrhage by going to all your doctor or midwife's visits when you are pregnant and following their advice. This will lower the chances that you will have a baby that is born too early. More on this topic

The approach to management and prognosis depends upon gender, location of the tumor within the urethra, and extent of disease. This topic will discuss the clinical presentation, evaluation, and treatment of urethral cancer. EPIDEMIOLOGY — An analysis from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database included 1075 men and 540 women with urethral cancer [1]. The age-adjusted incidence rate was 4.3 and 1.5 per million in men and women, respectively. The incidence increased with age, with a maximum of 32 per million in men and 9.5 per million in women aged 75 to 84 years. In addition to the higher incidence in men, urethral cancer was also approximately twice as common in African Americans as compared with Whites. A European study from the RARECARE project identified 1059 cases over a seven-year period and estimated that there are approximately 650 new cases per year in the European Union [2]. The age-standardized rates were 1.6 and 0.6 per million in men and women, respectively. RISK FACTORS — Although the etiology of urethral cancer is not well understood, factors that have been associated with urethral cancer include:
● Chronic inflammation. • Men with urethral cancer often have a history of sexually transmitted infections, urethritis, or urethral stricture [3,4]. As an example, in one study, men with urethral cancer reported a history of gonococcal urethritis, urethral stricture, or significant trauma in 37, 35, and 7 percent of cases, respectively [5,6]. Urethral strictures, which may develop following urethral trauma, are most frequently found in the bulbomembranous urethra, which is also the most common urethral segment involved with cancer [7]. • In women, urethral diverticuli have been implicated in the development of cancer in up to 5 percent of cases, probably due to secondary chronic inflammation [8]. Urinary stasis and infection may also be contributing factors. As an example, in one series of 90 women undergoing diverticulectomy, five (6 percent) were found to have invasive adenocarcinoma, with some others having evidence of intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia [9]. ● Human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 has been implicated in the development of both male and female urethral cancers [10-12]. As an example, in one series, HPV was identified in tumors from 11 of 18 women (61 percent) [10].",Urethral cancer is a rare but aggressive form of cancer that represents less than 1 percent of all genitourinary malignancies.,"Urethral cancer is not more prevalent in men than in women, as both genders have similar incidence rates.","While chronic inflammation is associated with urethral cancer, the exact nature of its role in the disease's development remains unclear."

● Urothelial carcinoma is often multifocal and may arise in the urethra simultaneously with, precede, or follow lesions of the bladder, ureters, or renal pelvis. (See ""Epidemiology and risk factors of urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma of the bladder"".) ANATOMY AND HISTOLOGYMen — Tumors of the male urethra are categorized by both location and histology. The male urethra extends from the bladder neck to the urethral meatus, averages 21 cm in length, and is divided into the prostatic, bulbomembranous, and penile urethra [13]. The prostatic and bulbomembranous urethra segments are lined with transitional epithelium that is similar to the bladder and upper urinary tract. The penile urethra is lined with pseudostratified columnar epithelium, and the meatus is lined with stratified squamous epithelium. The most common site of involvement is the bulbomembranous urethra, followed by the penile and prostatic urethra (60, 30, and 10 percent of cases, respectively). Most of the carcinomas of the penile and bulbomembranous urethra are squamous cell in origin, with urothelial and adenocarcinomas accounting for the minority of the cases [14]. In contrast, the vast majority of prostatic urethral carcinomas are urothelial in origin, although squamous cell carcinomas account for 10 percent of these cancers [15]. Urethral cancer can directly extend into contiguous organs, such as the penis, or spread via the lymphatics drainage into the inguinal and pelvic nodes. The distal urethra drains into superficial and deep inguinal lymph nodes, while the proximal urethra drains into the external iliac, obturator, and internal iliac lymph node chains [16]. Women — The female urethra averages 3 to 4 cm in length space and is divided into an anterior segment, which comprises the distal third, and a posterior segment, which comprises the proximal two-thirds of the urethra. The proximal one-third is composed of transitional epithelium, while the distal two-thirds is stratified squamous epithelium. Along the entire urethra, however, there are submucosal glands, which are composed of columnar epithelium [16]. The lymphatic drainage of the female urethra is analogous to the male, with the distal one-third draining into the superficial or deep inguinal nodes, while the proximal two-thirds drains into the pelvic lymph nodes [13]. Squamous cell carcinomas represent the predominant histology in women, accounting for up to 60 percent of urethral cancers, while 15 to 20 percent are urothelial carcinomas, and 5 to 7 percent are adenocarcinomas [15,17]. Proximal squamous cell carcinomas most likely arise from squamous metaplasia in the nonsquamous epithelium as a result of chronic inflammation. Mixed histologies are not uncommon and may be the result of differentiation of urothelial carcinoma into glandular and/or squamous components. Adenocarcinomas arise from Skene glands as a prostatic homologue, with resultant prostate-specific antigen (PSA) positivity in some cases [13], from glandular metaplasia leading to columnar/mucinous adenocarcinoma [16], and rarely, from other sources leading to clear cell adenocarcinoma [18-20]. CLINICAL PRESENTATION — The clinical presentation of urethral carcinoma varies depending upon gender.",The HPV 16 subtype is identified as a significant factor in certain cancers.,Urothelial carcinoma is not typically multifocal and does not arise in the urethra simultaneously with other lesions.,"While squamous cell carcinomas are common in women, the exact impact of chronic inflammation on their development remains uncertain."

Either external beam RT or brachytherapy may be used for anterior urethral tumors in men and more proximal tumors in women. RT alone may be sufficient in patients with localized tumors (stage T1 or T2) with or without radiosensitizing chemotherapy.","For male patients with invasive urothelial carcinoma, the standard treatment involves neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical cystoprostatectomy.","Radiation therapy is always preferred over surgery for all stages of urethral cancer, regardless of tumor invasiveness.","The choice between external beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy may depend on individual circumstances, but both have potential benefits and drawbacks."
./UTD2txt/18327.txt,"Locally advanced tumors are best treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, followed by assessment of the extent of disease prior to RT. Radiation may also be used for management of locally advanced disease not amenable to surgical resection, or for palliation in metastatic disease. In men, complication rates can be as high as 20 percent following RT and include fibrosis, radiation cystitis, urethritis, chronic penile edema, and rarely, fistula formation [30]. Urethral strictures may result from treatment with RT, and strictures require biopsy to rule out recurrent disease. In women, definitive RT is associated with good outcomes in early stage urethral cancers. In small series, local disease control rates between 60 and 100 percent have been reported using either brachytherapy, external beam RT, or a combination of both techniques [31-36]. In the largest reported series, 86 patients were treated with external beam RT, brachytherapy, or combination therapy after excision or biopsy [37]. The five-year local control rate was 64 percent. However, 27 of 55 patients (49 percent) who achieved local control had complications, most of which were considered moderate or severe in nature.

● Urothelial carcinoma is more common in men than in women. In men, urothelial carcinoma is the most common histology, while in women, squamous cell carcinoma is more common. Recurrent or persistent urethral stricture, dyspareunia, or unexplained lower urinary tract symptoms should warrant further work-up including thorough physical examination, imaging of the lower urinary tract, and cystoscopy. (See 'Anatomy and histology' above.)
● Early diagnosis is essential to maximizing the chance for cure. Diagnosis and staging include physical examination of the genitalia, perineum, and urethra, as well as bimanual examination. Cross-sectional imaging should be used for staging and to rule out distant disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) generally provides the best anatomic detail to define the local extent of urethral cancer. (See 'Diagnosis and evaluation' above.)
● For men with stage Ta, Tis, and T1, solitary, low-grade, papillary lesions, we suggest local treatment with transurethral (endoscopic) resection or fulguration (Grade 2C). This approach allows maximal functional preservation; however, it is associated with a high risk of recurrence, and vigilant endoscopic follow-up is required. Distal lesions that cannot be controlled with endoscopic resection are typically managed with distal partial penectomy. (See 'Men' above.) 
● For women with Ta, T1, and T2 lesions of the distal urethra, we suggest local surgical excision (Grade 2C). Radiation therapy is a reasonable alternative. (See 'Women' above.)
● In patients with locally advanced (stage T3 or T4) urethral cancer, management consists of a combined modality approach, including neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiation or surgery, or chemoradiotherapy followed by consolidation surgery. Surgical treatment consists of an en bloc resection of the urethra, prostate, and bladder, along with penectomy in men, and anterior vagina and bladder in women with or without a partial pubectomy.

• Fracture displacement is defined on the lateral view by the displacement of the distal fragment (dorsal or volar).",Analgesia and splinting are advisable before obtaining radiographs for patients with high suspicion of a displaced fracture.,A sling provides inadequate support for nondisplaced fractures while obtaining radiographs.,"Complications such as compartment syndrome may arise from supracondylar fractures, but their occurrence is not guaranteed in all cases."
./UTD2txt/5553.txt,"Other radiographic findings that may be present soon after injury include a volar fat pad on the lateral view and epiphyseal widening on stress views. However, stress views are painful for the patient and usually unnecessary. Plain radiographs obtained at least seven days after injury will show healing bone in children with nondisplaced Salter I fractures and also provides a definitive diagnosis. IMAGINGPlain radiographs — When obtaining radiographs in the child with a suspected distal forearm fracture, the necessary films should be taken with minimal movement of the extremity. In patients with an obvious deformity or where high suspicion for a displaced fracture exists, analgesia (eg, intranasal fentanyl or intravenous morphine) and splinting is advisable prior to obtaining radiographs. Otherwise, a sling typically provides adequate support of nondisplaced fractures and allows for radiographs to be obtained more easily. (See ""Distal forearm fractures in children: Initial management"", section on 'Analgesia and immobilization'.)
● Radiographic views – All patients with suspected forearm fractures need a true anteroposterior (AP) and lateral view of the injured forearm that includes the wrist and distal humerus. A good AP view of the forearm should have minimal superimposition of the radial tuberosity (located at the proximal radius) over the proximal ulna, and similar radiographic density for the proximal and distal forearm (image 3 and ) [19]. A true lateral view of the forearm has superimposition of the radial head upon the ulnar coronoid process at the proximal end, superimposition of the radius and ulna at the distal end, a view of the soft tissues around both bones, and an elbow position that is 90 degrees of flexion (image 4) [19]. If there is concern about a wrist and/or elbow fracture or dislocation based upon physical findings and/or initial forearm radiographs, the clinician should order separate wrist and/or elbow radiographs [5,6]. In addition, supracondylar fractures may complicate forearm fractures and cause an associated compartment syndrome. For this reason, anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the forearm should include the distal humerus in all patients with forearm fractures. ● Classification – Additional radiographic findings and examples of each type of distal forearm fracture are described below by fracture type. (See 'Specific fractures' below.) When describing and documenting a distal forearm fracture, the key elements include whether the fracture is open or closed; the presence of physeal involvement, angulation, displacement; and the presence of bony rotation [6]. • A closed fracture has no connection between the fracture site and any adjacent skin wounds whereas an open (compound) fracture has obvious bony protrusion through the skin or a contiguous open wound. (See 'Physical examination' below.)
• Physeal fractures are commonly described by using the Salter-Harris classification system and indicating whether the radius, ulna, or both bones are injured . (See ""General principles of fracture management: Fracture patterns and description in children"", section on 'Physeal fracture description'.)
• Distal metaphyseal fractures of the radius and/or ulna are described as torus (or buckle), greenstick, or complete fractures based upon the radiographic findings. (See 'Specific fractures' below.)

./UTD2txt/5553.txt,"Associated fractures — Forearm fractures are associated with supracondylar fractures in up to 5 percent of cases [25]. The combination of supracondylar and forearm fractures is termed the ""floating elbow"" and increases the possibility of compartment syndrome [26]. For this reason, anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the forearm should include the distal humerus in all patients with forearm fractures. Proximal humerus, clavicle, wrist, and hand fractures may also occur with a distal forearm fracture. Deformity and/or bony tenderness during physical examination dictate appropriate radiographic assessment of these areas in selected patients. Ultrasound — Detection and management of distal forearm fractures is a developing use of bedside ultrasound. However, most centers still use plain radiographs for diagnosis of forearm fractures and bedside fluoroscopy to check adequacy of fracture reduction. Further evidence is needed to determine if ultrasound can be performed instead of plain radiography.

Patients with a normal initial neurovascular examination warrant regular repeated evaluation, especially immediately following fracture manipulation or movement of the affected extremity. Although nerve injuries may rarely be associated with long-term sequelae, the majority are neurapraxias, such as, temporary loss of nerve function (especially motor function) without anatomical nerve disruption [10,11].

(See ""Evaluation and management of supracondylar fractures in children"", section on 'Vascular anatomy'.)
• Open wounds – Careful inspection of the entire forearm is necessary to detect an open fracture. Signs of an open fracture may be subtle because the bone often pokes through the skin and then retracts, leaving only a small puncture wound . In contrast to an abrasion or puncture from the outside of the arm overlying the fracture site, a small puncture resulting from an open fracture tends to ooze blood. If no active bleeding is noted, the clinician should attempt to express blood through the wound site as circumferential pressure will bring blood to the surface from a small open fracture. • Presence and location of tenderness or swelling – When there is no obvious deformity, tenderness over the distal radius or ulna and/or decreased grip strength indicates an increased likelihood of a fracture being present [33].

The patient should perform active range of motion of all joints that can safely be moved without exacerbating the injury (eg, supination, pronation, flexion, and extension or the elbow; abduction, adduction, internal and external rotation of the shoulder). • Associated injuries – When there is an isolated fracture evident in the radius or ulna, the clinician should check the joints above and below the fracture site for other injuries.

● Basics topic (see ""Patient education: Common wrist injuries (The Basics)"") SUMMARY
● Distal forearm fractures are among the most common fractures in children. The type and location of fracture varies by age with torus (buckle) and greenstick fractures most frequently occurring in children under 10 years of age, physeal (growth plate) fractures more likely in patients over 10 years of age, and complete fractures most common in adolescents. Older children tend to have more distal fracture location when compared to younger children. (See 'Epidemiology' above.)
● The child with a distal forearm fracture typically has a history of a fall on an outstretched hand with swelling, bony pain, and deformity. (See 'Clinical features' above.) 
● Physical examination of children with distal forearm fractures should focus on the presence of open wounds near the fracture site, careful neurovascular assessment, and identification of any injury to the wrist or elbow joints. Because of the anatomy of the interosseous membrane and the radioulnar articulations, any disruption or distal fracture of one bone is usually accompanied by fracture to the other (image 1) and may cause a tear in the triangular fibrocartilage complex . Thus, if only one bone appears to be fractured, the clinician should check the proximal and distal joints for injury to the other bone or the joint. (See 'Pertinent anatomy' above and 'Physical examination' above.)
● In patients with an obvious deformity or high suspicion for a displaced fracture, analgesia (eg, intranasal fentanyl or intravenous morphine) and splinting is advisable prior to obtaining radiographs. Otherwise, a sling typically provides adequate support of nondisplaced fractures and allows for radiographs to be obtained more easily. Adequate analgesia also facilitates a better assessment of sensory and motor function during physical examination. (See 'Imaging' above and 'Physical examination' above.)
● With the exception of nondisplaced Salter I physeal (growth plate) fractures or physeal microfractures (or ""bone bruises""), plain radiographs of the forearm (image 3 and  and image 4) provide the diagnosis. If radiographs are not readily available, then ultrasonography by a trained examiner can detect distal forearm fractures in children with high sensitivity and specificity. (See 'Plain radiographs' above and 'Ultrasound' above.)
● Children with a nondisplaced Salter I physeal fracture of the distal radius or ulna  usually have normal anteroposterior and lateral plain radiographs at initial presentation. However, bony tenderness is present over the physis in these patients, and this finding helps to differentiate this injury from a bruise or ligamentous strain or sprain. Plain radiographs obtained at least seven days after injury usually will show healing bone in children with nondisplaced Salter I fractures and also provides a definitive diagnosis. However, microfractures or a ""bone bruise"" of the physis may only be apparent upon magnetic resonance imaging with fat suppression. (See 'Nondisplaced Salter I fracture' above and 'Bone bruise' above.)
● Specific types of distal forearm fractures include (see 'Specific fractures' above): 
• Physeal fractures (image 7) 
• Torus (buckle) fractures (image 10) 
• Greenstick fractures (image 14) 
• Complete fractures (image 5)
• Ulnar styloid fractures (image 15) 
● Forearm fractures are associated with supracondylar fractures in up to 5 percent of cases. The combination of supracondylar and forearm fractures is termed the ""floating elbow"" and increases the possibility of compartment syndrome. For this reason, anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the forearm should include the distal humerus in all patients with forearm fractures. (See 'Specific fractures' above and 'Associated fractures' above.)
● The management of distal forearm fractures in children is discussed separately.

During the period between 2001 and 2008, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that there were 233 cases of tetanus in the United States, with an annual incidence of 0.10 cases/million population overall and 0.23 cases/million among individuals ≥65 years of age [1]. The case-fatality rate was 13.2 percent overall but was 31.3 percent among individuals ≥65 years of age. In 2009, 19 cases of tetanus and 2 deaths were reported in the United States through the national tetanus surveillance system [2]. Most patients with tetanus lack a history of receipt of a full series of tetanus toxoid immunization and receive inadequate prophylaxis following a wound [1,3,4]. Approximately three-fourths of patients who acquired tetanus in the United States between 2001 and 2008 recalled an acute injury prior to the onset of their symptoms, but approximately two-thirds of these individuals did not seek medical care [1]. Among 51 patients who sought care for an acute wound and had a sufficiently thorough surveillance report to allow evaluation, 49 (96 percent) did not receive adequate tetanus toxoid prophylaxis or tetanus toxoid prophylaxis plus tetanus immune globulin [1]. However, occasional patients with preexisting antitetanus antibodies (as measured by guinea pig or mouse protection assays) have developed tetanus [5].

In 2009, 19 cases of tetanus and 2 deaths were reported in the United States through the national tetanus surveillance system [2]. Most patients with tetanus lack a history of receipt of a full series of tetanus toxoid immunization and receive inadequate prophylaxis following a wound [1,3,4]. Approximately three-fourths of patients who acquired tetanus in the United States between 2001 and 2008 recalled an acute injury prior to the onset of their symptoms, but approximately two-thirds of these individuals did not seek medical care [1]. Among 51 patients who sought care for an acute wound and had a sufficiently thorough surveillance report to allow evaluation, 49 (96 percent) did not receive adequate tetanus toxoid prophylaxis or tetanus toxoid prophylaxis plus tetanus immune globulin [1]. However, occasional patients with preexisting antitetanus antibodies (as measured by guinea pig or mouse protection assays) have developed tetanus [5]. (See ""Tetanus-diphtheria toxoid vaccination in adults"" and ""Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis immunization in infants and children 0 through 6 years of age"", section on 'Indications' and ""Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis immunization in children 7 through 18 years of age"", section on 'Indications'.) Unlike in developing nations, neonatal tetanus is extremely rare in the United States. Only one case of neonatal tetanus was reported between 2001 and 2008; this case occurred in an infant whose mother had not been vaccinated [6]. Fifteen percent of patients with tetanus had diabetes mellitus, which is three times the estimated prevalence of diabetes in the United States. Another 15 percent of patients were injection drug users. The annual incidence of tetanus in other developed countries is also low and declining due to vaccination programs. In England and Wales, for example, the annual incidence was 0.2 cases/million population, with the highest incidence in patients above the age of 64 years [7].",Vaccination efforts have led to a dramatic decline in tetanus cases in developed nations over the decades.,"Neonatal tetanus is common in the United States, as indicated by the number of cases reported.",The relationship between diabetes mellitus and tetanus cases raises questions about other contributing factors.

./UTD2txt/17014.txt,"The pooled fatality rate of 3043 adult African patients reported in 27 studies was 43 percent (95% CI 37 to 50 percent) [14]. The high fatality rate likely reflects the fact that mechanical ventilation is often not available in African medical facilities. Longer incubation periods were associated with lower fatality rates. Neonatal tetanus, which the World Health Organization targeted for elimination by 1995, accounted for approximately 59,000 deaths in 2008 [15]. While this represents a decrease in mortality of 92 percent compared with 1988 [15], as of 2014, 24 countries had still not eliminated maternal and neonatal tetanus [16]. (See 'Neonatal tetanus' below.) PATHOGENESIS — Tetanus occurs when spores of Clostridium tetani, an obligate anaerobe normally present in the gut of mammals and widely found in soil, gains access to damaged human tissue. After inoculation, C.tetani transforms into a vegetative rod-shaped bacterium and produces the metalloprotease tetanospasmin (also known as tetanus toxin). After reaching the spinal cord and brainstem via retrograde axonal transport within the motor neuron, tetanus toxin is secreted and enters adjacent inhibitory interneurons, where it blocks neurotransmission by its cleaving action on the membrane proteins involved in neuroexocytosis [17-20]. The net effect is inactivation of inhibitory neurotransmission that normally modulates anterior horn cells and muscle contraction. This loss of inhibition (ie, disinhibition) of anterior horn cells and autonomic neurons results in increased muscle tone, painful spasms, and widespread autonomic instability. Muscular rigidity in tetanus occurs though a complex mechanism that involves an increase in the resting firing rate of disinhibited motor neurons and lack of inhibition of reflex motor responses to afferent sensory stimuli [21]. Lack of neural control of adrenal release of catecholamines induced by tetanus toxin produces a hypersympathetic state that manifests as sweating, tachycardia, and hypertension. (See 'Generalized tetanus' below.) Tetanus toxin-induced effects on anterior horns cells, the brainstem, and autonomic neurons are long lasting because recovery requires the growth of new axonal nerve terminals. (See 'Duration of illness' below.) The mechanisms of binding to and inhibition of neural cells are related to specific portions of the tetanospasmin (tetanus toxin) molecule. Tetanus toxin is produced initially as an inactive polypeptide chain by actively growing organisms. This synthesis is controlled by genes located in an intracellular plasmid. After death of the clostridial bacterium, the toxin is released and then activated by bacterial or tissue proteases into its active form, which contains a heavy chain necessary for binding and entry into neurons and a light chain responsible for its toxic properties [16,20-22]. Heavy chains are further cleaved by pepsins into specific fragments, which individually mediate binding to specific types of neural cells. Presynaptic inhibition of neurotransmitter release is mediated via light chains. Tetanolysin is another toxin produced by C.tetani during its early growth phase. It has hemolytic properties and causes membrane damage in other cells, but its role in clinical tetanus is uncertain. Predisposing factors — Because C.tetani will not grow in healthy tissues, a convergence of factors must be present in order for tetanus toxin to be elaborated in the human host. This combination of factors usually includes absence of antibodies (ie, from inadequate vaccination) plus two or more of the following:
● A penetrating injury resulting in the inoculation of C.tetani spores
● Coinfection with other bacteria
● Devitalized tissue
● A foreign body
● Localized ischemiaThe above factors explain why tetanus-prone injuries include splinters and other puncture wounds, gunshot wounds, compound fractures, burns, and unsterile intramuscular or subcutaneous injections (that often occur in injection drug users). These predisposing factors can also explain why tetanus can develop in unusual clinical settings such as in:
● Neonates (due to infection of the umbilical stump)

● Adolescents and adults undergoing male circumcision in sub-Saharan Africa [23]

./UTD2txt/17014.txt,"Tetanus has occurred rarely in patients who have received a timely and correct series of tetanus immunizations [25]. CLINICAL FEATURESIncubation period — The incubation period of tetanus is approximately 8 days but ranges from 3 to 21 days [26]. The incubation period is typically shorter in neonatal tetanus than in non-neonatal tetanus [16]. (See 'Neonatal tetanus' below.) Inoculation of spores in body locations distant from the central nervous system (eg, the hands or feet) results in a longer incubation period than inoculation close to the central nervous system (eg, the head or neck). Generalized tetanus — The most common and severe clinical form of tetanus is generalized tetanus. The presenting symptom in more than half of such patients is trismus (lockjaw), although patients with generalized tetanus sometimes present with cephalic or localized tetanus. Patients with generalized tetanus typically have symptoms of autonomic overactivity that may manifest in the early phases as irritability, restlessness, sweating, and tachycardia. In later phases of illness, profuse sweating, cardiac arrhythmias, labile hypertension or hypotension, and fever are often present. Patients with tetanus may develop reflex spasms of their masseter muscles rather than a (normal) gag response when their posterior pharynx is touched with a tongue blade or spatula (the spatula test). In one study of 400 consecutive patients with suspected tetanus, the sensitivity and specificity of this maneuver were high (94 and 100 percent, respectively) [27]. This test may even be useful in infants, but it is not useful when patients have severe trismus. Patients with generalized tetanus characteristically have tonic contraction of their skeletal muscles and intermittent intense muscular spasms. Since patients with tetanus have no impairment of consciousness or awareness, both the tonic contractions and spasms are intensely painful. Tetanic spasms may be triggered by loud noises or other sensory stimuli such as physical contact or light. Tonic and periodic spastic muscular contractions are responsible for most of the classic clinical findings of tetanus such as:
● Stiff neck
● Opisthotonus
● Risus sardonicus (sardonic smile)
● A board-like rigid abdomen
● Periods of apnea and/or upper airway obstruction due to vise-like contraction of the thoracic muscles and/or glottal or pharyngeal muscle contraction, respectively
● DysphagiaDuring generalized tetanic spasms, patients characteristically clench their fists, arch their back, and flex and abduct their arms while extending their legs, often becoming apneic during these dramatic postures. Local tetanus — Rarely, tetanus presents with tonic and spastic muscle contractions in one extremity or body region. Local tetanus often but not invariably evolves into generalized tetanus. Diagnosis in local tetanus can be difficult. For example, rarely patients with early tetanus may develop board-like abdominal rigidity that mimics an acute surgical abdomen. Cephalic tetanus — Patients with injuries to the head or neck may present with cephalic tetanus, involving initially only cranial nerves. Like other forms of local tetanus, patients with cephalic tetanus often subsequently develop generalized tetanus. Prior to the appearance of the typical features of generalized tetanus, patients with cephalic tetanus may manifest confusing clinical findings including dysphagia, trismus, and focal cranial neuropathies that can lead to a misdiagnosis of stroke [28]. The facial nerve is most commonly in cephalic tetanus [29], but involvement of cranial nerves VI, III, IV, and XII may also occur either alone or in combination with others. Neonatal tetanus — Neonatal tetanus occurs as a result of the failure to use aseptic techniques in managing the umbilical stump in offspring of mothers who are poorly immunized. The application of unconventional substances to the umbilical stump (eg, ghee or clarified butter, juices, and cow dung) have been implicated as common cultural practices that contribute to neonatal tetanus [30]. Neonatal tetanus can also result from unclean hands and instruments or contamination by dirt, straw, or other nonsterile materials in the delivery field. Neonatal tetanus typically occurs in infants 5 to 7 days following birth (range 3 to 24 days) [16]. The onset of illness is typically more rapid in neonatal tetanus than in older individuals and may progress over hours rather than days, probably because axonal length is proportionately shorter in infants [31]. Neonatal tetanus presents with refusal to feed and difficulty opening the mouth due to trismus [16]. Sucking then stops and facial muscles spasm, which may result in risus sardonicus (sardonic smile). The hands are often clenched, the feet become dorsiflexed, and muscle tone increases. As the disease progresses, neonates become rigid and opisthotonus (spasm of spinal extensors) develops. Severity of illness — The severity and frequency of the clinical features of tetanus may vary from case to case, depending upon the amount of tetanus toxin that reaches the central nervous system. Symptoms and signs may progress for up to two weeks after the disease onset. The severity is related to the incubation period of the illness and the interval from the onset of symptoms to the appearance of spasms [21]; the longer the interval, the milder the clinical features of tetanus. In addition, illness may be milder in patients with preexisting but nonprotective levels of antitetanus antibodies. In one study of 64 patients with tetanus, serum obtained prior to the institution of treatment contained detectable levels of antibody in 35 percent of patients, and the severity of tetanus in these patients appeared to be inversely related to the level of pretreatment antitetanus toxin antibody [32]. Duration of illness — Tetanus toxin-induced effects are long lasting because recovery requires the growth of new axonal nerve terminals. The usual duration of clinical tetanus is four to six weeks. DIAGNOSIS — The diagnosis of tetanus is usually obvious and can generally be made based upon typical clinical findings outlined above. Tetanus should especially be suspected when there is a history of an antecedent tetanus-prone injury and a history of inadequate immunization for tetanus. However, tetanus can sometimes be confused with other processes, as discussed in the following section.",Tetanus is infrequently seen in individuals who have received proper and timely tetanus vaccinations.,Patients with tetanus often experience a significant impairment of consciousness and awareness.,"The severity of tetanus symptoms can vary greatly, leading to both mild and severe clinical presentations in different patients."

Tetanus toxoid alone should be given only to those patients with documented allergy or untoward reactions to diphtheria toxoid. (See ""Tetanus-diphtheria toxoid vaccination in adults"".) Control of muscle spasms — Generalized muscle spasms are life threatening since they can cause respiratory failure, lead to aspiration, and induce generalized exhaustion in the patient. Several drugs may be used to control these spasms. Attention to placement of the patient and control of light or noise in the room in an effort to avoid provoking muscle spasms was an important component of care for patients with tetanus in the past before the availability of drugs to prevent spasms. These measures are still vital in regions where the availability of neuromuscular blocking agents may be limited [11]. Benzodiazepines and other sedatives — Benzodiazepines have been used traditionally and are generally effective in controlling the rigidity and spasms associated with tetanus [11]. They also provide a sedative effect. Diazepam has been used most frequently, but other benzodiazepines are as effective as diazepam. Patients with tetanus often show tolerance to the sedating effects of benzodiazepines and may remain awake and alert after receiving doses that would sedate or cause anesthesia in other patients [25]. For tetanus, the usual starting dose of diazepam for an adult is 10 to 30 mg IV and repeated as needed every 1 to 4 hours; total daily doses as high as 500 mg may be required for an adult. Ventilatory assistance is imperative at these higher doses.",Benzodiazepines are traditionally effective in controlling the rigidity and spasms associated with tetanus.,"Patients with tetanus do not develop tolerance to the sedating effects of benzodiazepines, allowing them to remain sedated after receiving normal doses.","Although diazepam is the most frequently used benzodiazepine, it is unclear whether other benzodiazepines provide sufficient sedative effects in all patients."
./UTD2txt/17014.txt,"However, a number of methodologic issues might have affected this study. The mortality rate for tetanus patients fell during the study period from 35 percent in historical controls to 12 percent among control patients in this study. While tetanus cases were graded upon admission, these grades were not reported, and the only note of more patients with grade III and IV disease among the controls compared with those receiving intrathecal immunoglobulin implies that these differences arose during the course of therapy. The investigators refer to tetanus hyperimmune globulin but merely list a lyophilized human immunoglobulin in the methods section. In countries in which HTIG is not readily available, equine antitoxin is used intramuscularly or intravenously. When equine antitoxin is used, an intradermal test dose of 0.1 mL in a 1:10 dilution should be administered prior to giving the full dose in order to evaluate for hypersensitivity reactions [11]. In contrast, antecedent skin testing is not needed if a human preparation is to be used. Infiltration of antitoxin, either human or equine, into the wound has sometimes been advocated but is of unproven value. The use of pooled intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) has been proposed as a possible alternative to HTIG [40]. Active immunization — Since tetanus is one of the few bacterial diseases that does not confer immunity following recovery from acute illness, all patients with tetanus should receive active immunization with a total of three doses of tetanus and diphtheria toxoid spaced at least two weeks apart, commencing immediately upon diagnosis. Tetanus toxoid should be administered at a different site than tetanus immune globulin. It should be assumed that anyone who is not adequately vaccinated or protected against tetanus is also inadequately protected against diphtheria [9]. The tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) may be used instead of Td but, if used, recommendations are for this formulation to be used only once in adults, except in pregnant women, who should receive Tdap during each pregnancy [42-44]. Specific recommendations for the use of vaccines to protect against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis in adults, pregnant women, and children are discussed in detail separately. (See ""Tetanus-diphtheria toxoid vaccination in adults"", section on 'Indications for Td or Tdap vaccination' and ""Pertussis infection in adolescents and adults: Treatment and prevention"", section on 'Prevention' and ""Immunizations during pregnancy"", section on 'Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccination' and ""Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis immunization in infants and children 0 through 6 years of age"" and ""Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis immunization in children 7 through 18 years of age"".)

./UTD2txt/4895.txt,"Definition and classification of the cardiomyopathies Author:Leslie T Cooper, Jr, MD Section Editor:William J McKenna, MD Deputy Editor:Susan B Yeon, MD, JD, FACCContributor INTRODUCTION — Cardiomyopathies are diseases of heart muscle [1]. A contemporary definition for cardiomyopathy is a myocardial disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease, and congenital heart disease sufficient to explain the observed myocardial abnormality. Cardiomyopathies include a variety of myocardial disorders that manifest with various structural and functional phenotypes and are frequently genetic. Although some have defined cardiomyopathy to include myocardial disease caused by known cardiovascular causes (such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, or valvular disease), current major society definitions of cardiomyopathy exclude heart disease secondary to such cardiovascular disorders. Definitions and classification systems for cardiomyopathies are described here. The individual disorders and the evaluation of the patient with heart failure or cardiomyopathy are discussed separately. (See ""Determining the etiology and severity of heart failure or cardiomyopathy"" and ""Causes of dilated cardiomyopathy"" and ""Idiopathic restrictive cardiomyopathy"" and ""Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy: Anatomy, histology, and clinical manifestations"" and ""Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation"".) DEFINITION — In 1980, the World Health Organization (WHO) defined cardiomyopathies as ""heart muscle diseases of unknown cause"" to distinguish cardiomyopathy from cardiac dysfunction due to known cardiovascular entities such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, or valvular disease [2]. In clinical practice, however, the term ""cardiomyopathy"" has also been applied to diseases of known cardiovascular cause (eg, ""ischemic cardiomyopathy"" and ""hypertensive cardiomyopathy""). As a result, the 1995 WHO/International Society and Federation of Cardiology (ISFC) Task Force on the Definition and Classification of the Cardiomyopathies expanded the classification to include all diseases affecting heart muscle and to take into consideration etiology as well as the dominant pathophysiology [3]. In this 1995 classification, the cardiomyopathies were defined as ""diseases of the myocardium associated with cardiac dysfunction."" They were classified according to anatomy and physiology into the following types, each of which has multiple different causes:
● Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)
● Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)
● Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)

The 1995 WHO/ISFC classification system included ischemic, valvular, and hypertensive disease among the causes of cardiomyopathy. A 2006 AHA scientific statement proposed a contemporary definition and classification of the cardiomyopathies [4]. The expert consensus panel proposed the following definition: ""Cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of diseases of the myocardium associated with mechanical and/or electrical dysfunction that usually (but not invariably) exhibit inappropriate ventricular hypertrophy or dilation and are due to a variety of causes that frequently are genetic. Cardiomyopathies either are confined to the heart or are a part of generalized systemic disorders, often leading to cardiovascular death or progressive heart failure-related disability."" Cardiomyopathies are categorized into two groups: primary cardiomyopathies (predominantly involving the heart) and secondary cardiomyopathies (accompanied by other organ system involvement). The primary cardiomyopathies are subdivided into those which are genetic, mixed (predominantly nongenetic; less commonly genetic), or acquired. The genetic cardiomyopathies include HCM, ARVC/D, left ventricular noncompaction, PRKAG2 and Danon glycogen storage diseases, conduction defects, mitochondrial myopathies, and ion channel disorders. The mixed cardiomyopathies include DCM and RCM. The acquired cardiomyopathies include myocarditis, stress-induced (takotsubo), peripartum, tachycardia-induced, and infants of insulin-dependent diabetic mothers. The AHA definition and classification are not intended to provide methodologies for clinical diagnosis, but are rather a scientific scheme that aims to aid in the understanding of this complex group of disorders.

./UTD2txt/4895.txt,"Nevertheless, in clinical practice, the terms ""ischemic,"" ""valvular,"" and ""hypertensive cardiomyopathy"" have been used commonly, particularly in North America. The 1995 WHO/ISFC Task Force used the term ""specific cardiomyopathy"" to reflect this reality and the fact that the genetic basis of the cardiomyopathies was being elucidated. The 2008 ESC proposal provides a clinical approach to diagnosing a patient who presents with symptoms, a family history of cardiomyopathy, or electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities that are otherwise unexplained. Like the 2006 AHA proposal, it focuses on the established morphological types described by the 1995 WHO/ISFC Task Force (HCM, DCM, ARVC, RCM). The AHA, ESC, and MOGE(S) classification systems then go on to define the familial and, if possible, genetic basis of disease. The use of the term ""cardiomyopathy"" to describe valvular, ischemic, or hypertensive heart disease unnecessarily broadens a term best suited to predominantly reflect genetically determined diseases with recognizable phenotypes. However, the term ""ischemic cardiomyopathy"" continues to be used by some, including the 2013 American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association heart failure guidelines, the 2010 Heart Failure Society of America guidelines, and the 2008 Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines [11-13]. ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION — Identification of various cardiomyopathy phenotypes relies primarily upon echocardiographic evaluation. Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography can, in most cases, define the anatomic and functional characteristics of the heart that are diagnostic of dilated, hypertrophic, arrhythmogenic right ventricular, or restrictive cardiomyopathy. (See ""Echocardiographic recognition of cardiomyopathies"".) In select cases, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography may be useful to identify and localize fat, iron, or amyloid infiltration, inflammation, scar/fibrosis, focal hypertrophy, left ventricular (LV) apical aneurysm, and right ventricular structure and function. (See ""Clinical utility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging"", section on 'Cardiomyopathy' and ""Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Morphologic variants and the pathophysiology of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction"".) Systolic dysfunction — Systolic dysfunction is characterized by a decrease in myocardial contractility. When myocardial contractility is decreased globally (ie, throughout the LV), a reduction in the LV ejection fraction (LVEF) results. While a variety of approaches are available for the quantitative measurement of LV systolic function, the LVEF is often assessed qualitatively. (See ""Tests to evaluate left ventricular systolic function"".) When systolic dysfunction occurs, cardiac output is initially maintained in two ways:
● LV enlargement, which results in a higher stroke volume
● The Frank-Starling relationship (an increase in contractility in response to increasing stretch) However, these compensatory mechanisms are eventually exceeded and cardiac output decreases, resulting in the physiologic manifestations of heart failure (HF). (See ""Pathophysiology of heart failure: Left ventricular pressure-volume and other hemodynamic relationships"".) Systolic dysfunction is characteristic of dilated cardiomyopathy. It is also seen in some patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) who develop progressive LV wall thinning, a small increase in diastolic dimension, and a decrease in LVEF. (See ""Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Natural history and prognosis"".) Diastolic dysfunction — Diastolic dysfunction refers to cardiac dysfunction in which LV relaxation and filling is abnormal and is accompanied by elevated filling pressures. Diastolic dysfunction may occur with or without associated systolic dysfunction. In patients presenting with HF but without systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction is the presumed cause. (See ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction"".) The LV diastole includes two components . LV relaxation is a dynamic process that takes place during isovolumic relaxation (the period between aortic valve closure and mitral valve opening) and then during early rapid filling of the ventricle. Later in diastole, after relaxation is complete, further LV filling is a passive process that is dependent on the compliance or distensibility of the myocardium and ends in the atrial filling phase. Either active relaxation or passive compliance or both may be impaired in a patient with diastolic dysfunction. (See ""Pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction"".) Diastolic dysfunction is more difficult to identify and quantitate echocardiographically than systolic dysfunction, and may be missed or underestimated in many cases. Echocardiographic evaluation of LV diastolic dysfunction includes Doppler assessment of transmitral flow and pulmonary venous flow as well as tissue Doppler imaging. (See ""Echocardiographic evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function"".) Diastolic dysfunction is characteristic of both HCM and restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). However, some component of diastolic dysfunction is also common in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). The syndrome of HF with normal or near normal LV systolic function has been termed ""HF with preserved ejection fraction"" (HF-PEF) or ""HF with normal ejection fraction"" (HF-NEF). However, this category (HF-NEF or HF-PEF) encompasses a mixed group of clinical syndromes that included HF-PEF as well as other conditions such as valvular heart disease, pericardial disease, and right HF. (See ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction"", section on 'Introduction'.) ANATOMIC AND PHYSIOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION — Cardiomyopathies are classified into the following categories based upon morphology and physiology. Some cardiac disorders may present as more than one type of cardiomyopathy or may cross classification categories as they progress, as illustrated by the following examples: 
● Amyloid cardiomyopathy, which may present as a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or as a restrictive cardiomyopathy. (See ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of amyloid cardiomyopathy"".)
● Cardiac sarcoidosis that may progress from manifesting as a focal wall motion abnormality to a dilated or restrictive cardiomyopathy often with heart block and ventricular arrhythmias as early presenting features. (See ""Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis"".) Dilated cardiomyopathy — Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterized by dilation and impaired contraction of one or both ventricles [14]. The dilation often becomes severe and is invariably accompanied by an increase in total cardiac mass (hypertrophy) (image 1).","The terms 'ischemic,' 'valvular,' and 'hypertensive cardiomyopathy' are frequently used in North America, indicating a widespread recognition of these conditions in clinical practice.","The term 'cardiomyopathy' is universally accepted to include valvular, ischemic, and hypertensive heart disease without any debate over its appropriateness.","While systolic dysfunction is often associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, it may also occur in other forms, suggesting a complex interplay among different cardiomyopathies."
./UTD2txt/4895.txt,"Nevertheless, in clinical practice, the terms ""ischemic,"" ""valvular,"" and ""hypertensive cardiomyopathy"" have been used commonly, particularly in North America. The 1995 WHO/ISFC Task Force used the term ""specific cardiomyopathy"" to reflect this reality and the fact that the genetic basis of the cardiomyopathies was being elucidated. The 2008 ESC proposal provides a clinical approach to diagnosing a patient who presents with symptoms, a family history of cardiomyopathy, or electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities that are otherwise unexplained. Like the 2006 AHA proposal, it focuses on the established morphological types described by the 1995 WHO/ISFC Task Force (HCM, DCM, ARVC, RCM). The AHA, ESC, and MOGE(S) classification systems then go on to define the familial and, if possible, genetic basis of disease. The use of the term ""cardiomyopathy"" to describe valvular, ischemic, or hypertensive heart disease unnecessarily broadens a term best suited to predominantly reflect genetically determined diseases with recognizable phenotypes.

ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION — Identification of various cardiomyopathy phenotypes relies primarily upon echocardiographic evaluation. Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography can, in most cases, define the anatomic and functional characteristics of the heart that are diagnostic of dilated, hypertrophic, arrhythmogenic right ventricular, or restrictive cardiomyopathy. (See ""Echocardiographic recognition of cardiomyopathies"".)

The echocardiogram in DCM shows LV cavitary dilation (with a tendency for the shape of the cavity to become less ovoid and more spherical), normal or decreased wall thickness, poor wall thickening, and/or reduced inward endocardial systolic motion (movie 1). In addition to these changes in the LV, other findings include left atrial enlargement and, less often, right ventricular enlargement and dysfunction. In such patients, all four chambers may be dilated. (See ""Echocardiographic recognition of cardiomyopathies"", section on 'Dilated cardiomyopathy'.) Coronary artery disease and valve disease are other causes of ventricular dilation with systolic dysfunction (commonly called ""ischemic cardiomyopathy"" or ""valvular cardiomyopathy,"" although these are not defined as cardiomyopathies under current American Heart Association/European Society of Cardiology [AHA/ESC] classification systems). These causes of heart disease should be distinguished from DCM for appropriate genetic counseling and clinical management. (See ""Ischemic cardiomyopathy: Treatment and prognosis"" and ""Management of chronic primary mitral regurgitation"" and ""Natural history and management of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults"".)   Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy — HCM is a clinically heterogeneous disorder caused by a variety of mutations associated with hypertrophy of the LV, and occasionally of the right ventricle [17]. The term ""HCM"" is also used in a broader sense in the 2006 AHA and 2008 ESC classification system to include a variety of conditions with increased ventricular wall thickness or mass not caused by pathologic loading conditions (eg, hypertension or valve disease) ( and ).","Patients with DCM may experience dilation in all four heart chambers, suggesting a severe form of the disease.","The summary claims that the causes of heart disease, including valve disease, are the same as those for DCM.","Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy encompasses a range of conditions, but it is debatable how closely related these conditions are to DCM."
./UTD2txt/4895.txt,"The prevalence of HCM in the absence of aortic valve disease or systemic hypertension is at least 1:500 of the adult population [18]. The interventricular septum is typically more prominently involved than the LV free wall, but concentric and apical hypertrophy can occur (image 2 and movie 2). (See ""Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation"" and ""Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Morphologic variants and the pathophysiology of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction"" and ""Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Gene mutations and clinical genetic testing"".) The LV volume is normal or reduced in HCM, and diastolic dysfunction is usually present. Systolic pressure gradients in the left ventricular outflow tract during resting conditions are found in approximately one-quarter of patients. Characteristic histologic changes include myocyte hypertrophy and disarray, which usually corresponds to the areas of greatest hypertrophy  [19,20]. In approximately 60 to 70 percent of patients, HCM is caused by mutations in sarcomeric contractile protein genes and is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete penetrance. The most common mutations are in the beta myosin heavy chain and the cardiac myosin-binding protein C genes [21]. (See ""Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Gene mutations and clinical genetic testing"".)

Ethnic differences also affect the degree of LVH and echocardiographic abnormalities. Black women athletes have a greater degree of LVH and repolarization abnormalities than white women athletes [22].

Left ventricular noncompaction — LV noncompaction, also called isolated ventricular noncompaction, is a rare unclassified cardiomyopathy with an altered myocardial wall due to intrauterine arrest of compaction of the loose interwoven meshwork. There is continuity between the LV cavity and deep intratrabecular recesses that are filled with blood from the ventricular cavity without evidence of communication to the epicardial arterial system .

EPIDEMIOLOGY — Estimates of the true burden of NTM infections in children are unavailable; in part because NTM infections may be asymptomatic and because NTM infections are not communicable, reporting of NTM infections is not required in the United States or many other countries [2]. Nonetheless, the overall prevalence of NTM disease appears to be increasing with time (possibly as a result of enhanced detection) [16-20]. (See ""Epidemiology of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections"".) Disseminated NTM is rare in immune-competent children. In a prospective surveillance study, only 3 of 192 children with confirmed or probable NTM infection had disseminated disease [21]. Two of the cases occurred in immunocompromised children with intravenous catheter-related bacteremia. Most case series of disseminated NTM describe disseminated M.avium complex (MAC) in children with acquired immunodeficiency virus [22,23]. However, with the advent of potent antiretroviral therapy, the incidence of disseminated MAC in human immunodeficiency virus-positive children has declined [11,24,25]. NTM are transmitted through environmental sources.","In children with indwelling vascular catheters, species like Mycobacterium mucogenicum have been documented as causes of NTM infections.",NTM infections do not occur in children with indwelling vascular catheters.,The epidemiology of NTM infections is complicated by the fact that many infections may go undiagnosed or unreported.
./UTD2txt/5547.txt,"Water (from both natural and treated sources) is a common reservoir [12-14,26-30]. Aquatic transmission of NTM is facilitated by the formation of biofilms, which permit survival under a variety of environmental conditions and, through detachment, allow dissemination of large numbers of organisms [31]. (See ""Pathogenesis of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections"".) The respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts are the usual portal of entry for disseminated disease. However, direct inoculation may occur. NTM bacteremia in pediatric oncology patients has been reported after flushing central lines with tap water and when inadequate chlorination allowed proliferation of NTM species in water from hospital faucets [12-14]. The incubation period is variable [9]. RISK FACTORS — Cases of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) bacteremia or disseminated NTM disease in children have been reported among children with:
● Congenital defects in interferon gamma and interleukin (IL)-12 synthesis and response pathways, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) mutations [32-37] (see ""Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases: Specific defects"") While children with severe combined immunodeficiency, DiGeorge syndrome, chronic granulomatous disease, and hyperimmunoglobulin M syndrome also have defects in portions of the IL-12 pathway, they are not prone to disseminated infection with NTM species [38]. ● Chemotherapy for malignancy [39]
● Solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [39-42] (see ""Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections in solid organ transplant candidates and recipients"")
● Intravenous catheter (particularly in immune-compromised patients) [10,15,21,43-45]

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome — Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) refers to clinical worsening while receiving effective antimycobacterial chemotherapy and is well described in HIV-infected patients [68]. IRIS can result in worsening of existing symptoms (paradoxical IRIS) or new onset of opportunistic infections after immune reconstitution (unmasking IRIS). The most common symptoms of NTM IRIS include fever, abdominal pain, subcutaneous nodules, and suppurative lymphadenitis. One series reported NTM-induced IRIS in 9 (5 percent) of 153 HIV-infected children 2 to 26 weeks after initiation of ART; MAC and Mycobacterium scrofulaceum were the most common isolates [69]. Another pediatric series documented IRIS from a number of causes, mycobacterial and otherwise, in up to 20 percent of HIV-infected children initiating ART; IRIS was associated with malnutrition and high viral loads [70]. Although IRIS has been associated with death (primarily from rapidly enlarging lymph nodes causing airway compression or expansile central nervous system lesions causing brainstem herniation), most IRIS cases are mild and can be managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications or glucocorticoids [68]. (See ""Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome"".) Response to therapy — Most patients who are treated for disseminated NTM infection have improvement in fever after two to four weeks and improvement in symptoms after four to six weeks of initial therapy [47]. However, clinical improvement may be delayed in patients with extensive disease or advanced immunosuppression. Patients who do not have clinical improvement after four to eight weeks of initial therapy should have NTM blood culture repeated. Clearance of NTM from the blood may take up to 12 weeks.

● Treatment of disseminated NTM is usually undertaken in consultation with an expert in infectious diseases. If NTM bacteremia or disseminated disease is associated with a vascular catheter, the catheter must be removed. (See 'General principles' above.)
● We suggest that disseminated NTM disease be treated initially with at least three drugs to which the isolate is susceptible (or likely to be susceptible if susceptibility testing is pending) (Grade 2C). Appropriate drugs may include macrolides, ethambutol, rifamycins, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones . The initial regimen is continued for one to two months or until there is clinical and radiographic improvement. (See 'Antimycobacterial therapy' above and 'Initial phase' above.)
● The initial treatment phase is followed by a continuation phase. We suggest that during the continuation phase, children with disseminated NTM infection be treated with two drugs to which the isolate is susceptible (Grade 2C). If possible, both of these drugs should be administered orally. The total duration of therapy is 6 to 12 months. (See 'Continuation phase' above and 'Duration' above.)
● Antimycobacterial prophylaxis may prevent disseminated NTM infection in immune-compromised patients. We recommend prophylaxis against MAC for children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and low CD4 counts (Grade 1A). We suggest that children with HIV infection who develop MAC receive lifelong MAC prophylaxis (Grade 2C). (See 'Prevention' above.)
● Survival of disseminated NTM disease is enhanced by immune system recovery (eg, initiation of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected children or reduction of immunosuppressive regimen in organ transplant recipients). (See 'Outcome' above.)",Consultation with an infectious diseases expert is usually necessary for treating disseminated NTM.,It is unnecessary to remove vascular catheters associated with NTM bacteremia or disseminated disease.,"The initial treatment for disseminated NTM may involve three drugs, but the choice of these drugs can be influenced by factors not fully detailed in the guidelines."

The MIP reflects the strength of the diaphragm and other inspiratory muscles, while the MEP reflects the strength of the abdominal muscles and other expiratory muscles. A well validated alternative or additional test of inspiratory muscle strength is maximal sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP).

CLINICAL APPLICATION — Once testing is complete and the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximal expiratory pressure (MEP), and sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP) have been determined, they can be applied to the patient. The MIP, MEP, and SNIP are rarely used alone; rather, they are considered in conjunction with other measures, most commonly the vital capacity (VC) or the forced vital capacity (FVC). Common settings in which the MIP, MEP, and SNIP are helpful include:
● Diagnosis of respiratory muscle weakness
● Assessment of the severity of respiratory muscle weakness, including prediction of clinical sequelae
● Following the course of the respiratory muscle weaknessThe role of the MIP, MEP, and SNIP in each of these settings is discussed in detail in this section. Pulmonary function testing in the evaluation of respiratory muscle weakness is discussed separately.

We measure upright and supine FVC. When doubt persists about whether a patient has respiratory muscle weakness [15], we perform more complex tests. Threshold values that may prompt mechanical ventilation are discussed separately. (See ""Respiratory muscle weakness due to neuromuscular disease: Clinical manifestations and evaluation"", section on 'Assess need for ventilatory support'.) ADDITIONAL TESTS (INVASIVE) — When the diagnosis of respiratory muscle weakness is in doubt, some clinicians will perform more invasive testing. These complex measurements are best made in specialist centers and can reliably diagnose respiratory muscle weakness. ● Sniff esophageal pressure is a good volitional test of overall inspiratory muscle strength [46]. ● Sniff transdiaphragmatic pressure (Sniff Pdi), measured by esophageal and gastric balloon catheters, provides an accurate measure of specific diaphragm strength [47]. ● Gastric pressure, measured with a gastric balloon catheter following maximal cough efforts, reflects expiratory (particularly abdominal) muscle strength [40]. If patients, including those in intensive care unit (ICU), are unable to make maximal volitional efforts, diaphragm strength can be assessed by measuring Pdi following unilateral or bilateral electrical or magnetic phrenic nerve stimulation [48-50]. Non volitional abdominal (expiratory) muscle strength can be measured by recording gastric pressure following surface magnetic stimulation posteriorly in the mid line at the level of T10 [51]. Phrenic nerve stimulation, in combination with the recording of diaphragm EMG by an esophageal electrode, allows measurement of phrenic nerve latency and the amplitude of the compound muscle action potential (CMAP) [52]. Using these complex tests respiratory muscle function and strength can be accurately assessed in virtually all patients; for example, such tests accurately predict survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).","The combination of various tests, including MIP and FVC, is crucial for making informed clinical decisions regarding respiratory muscle weakness.",Clinicians rarely need to perform more complex tests when assessing patients for respiratory muscle weakness.,"While measuring diaphragm strength through various techniques is beneficial, the implications of these measurements on treatment decisions remain uncertain."

A vta; capacity (VC) within normal range suggests a good prognosis at three months but is of little other value. Sequential data show a linear decline for direct measures of respiratory muscle strength, whereas VC shows little or no decline until 12 months before death or ventilation [53]. SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
● Respiratory muscle strength can be assessed noninvasively by measuring the maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP or PImax), maximal sniff nasal inspiratory pressure (SNIP), and the maximal expiratory pressure (MEP or PEmax). The MIP and SNIP reflect the strength of the diaphragm and other inspiratory muscles, while the MEP reflects the strength of the abdominal muscles and other expiratory muscles. (See 'Introduction' above.)
● Common indications for measurement of the MIP, SNIP, and MEP include clinically suspected respiratory muscle weakness, lung function consistent with respiratory muscle weakness (eg, restrictive pattern, low vital capacity, raised diffusion capacity), and evaluation of whether respiratory muscle weakness has improved, remained stable, or worsened. (See 'Introduction' above.)
● Abnormal respiratory muscle strength is identified by comparing the MIP, SNIP, and MEP to a reference range. When lung hyperinflation exists, the MIP and SNIP are reduced independent of muscle strength. (See 'Reference range' above.)
● A normal MIP and/or SNIP reliably excludes inspiratory muscle weakness (ie, good negative predictive value), but a low MIP does not reliably confirm inspiratory muscle weakness (ie, poor positive predictive value), since submaximal patient effort or poor technique are common. When a low MIP is recorded, the measurement of SNIP is helpful to confirm weakness; it is known that multiple tests increase diagnostic accuracy. (See 'Interpretation' above.) 
● Potential sources of error that should be considered include patient effort and technique, pressure gauge accuracy, and the patient-device interface. (See 'Quality assurance' above.)
● Once testing is complete and the MIP, SNIP, and MEP have been determined, the measures can be applied to the patient. This may include diagnosis of respiratory muscle weakness, determination of its severity, prediction of its clinical sequelae, or evaluation of its clinical course. (See 'Clinical application' above.)
● When the diagnosis of respiratory muscle weakness is in doubt, some clinicians will perform more invasive testing including sniff esophageal pressure, sniff transdiaphragmatic pressure, and gastric pressure, all of which require the insertion of a pressure measuring catheters and phrenic nerve stimulation to measure twitch transdiaphragmatic pressure (Twitch Pdi).

./UTD2txt/4881.txt,"| This topic last updated: Jul 19, 2017. DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS OVERVIEW — Venous thrombosis is a condition in which a blood clot (thrombus) forms in a vein. This clot can limit blood flow through the vein, causing swelling and pain. Most commonly, venous thrombosis occurs in the ""deep veins"" in the legs, thighs, or pelvis ; this is called a deep vein thrombosis, or DVT. DVT is the most common type of venous thrombosis. However, a thrombus can form anywhere in the venous system. If a part or all of the blood clot in the vein breaks off from the site where it is formed, it can travel through the venous system; this is called an embolus. If the embolus lodges in the lung, it is called pulmonary embolism (PE), a serious condition that leads to over 50,000 deaths a year in the United States. In most cases, PE is caused when part of a DVT breaks off and lodges in the lung. The term ""venous thromboembolism"" is sometimes used when discussing both DVT and PE. This topic review discusses the risk factors, signs and symptoms, diagnostic process, and treatment of a deep vein thrombosis. The diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary embolisms are discussed separately. (See ""Patient education: Pulmonary embolism (Beyond the Basics)"".) DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS RISK FACTORS — There are a number of factors that increase a person's risk of developing a deep vein thrombosis. If a person is found to have a DVT and there is no known medical condition or recent surgery that could have caused the DVT, it is possible that an inherited condition is the cause. This is especially true in people with a family member who has also experienced a DVT or pulmonary embolism. In these cases, testing for an inherited thrombophilia may be recommended. However, finding an inherited thrombophilia does not change the way that doctors treat the venous thromboembolism, and may not increase the chance of the blood clot coming back. (See 'Finding the cause of venous thrombosis' below.) Medical conditions or medications — Some medical conditions and medications increase a person's risk of developing a blood clot:
● Pregnancy
● Obesity
● Smoking
● Heart failure
● Previous DVT or pulmonary embolism (PE)
● Increased age
● Cancer – Some cancers increase substances in the blood that cause blood to clot. ● Kidney problems, such as nephrotic syndrome (see ""Patient education: The nephrotic syndrome (Beyond the Basics)"")
● Certain medications (eg, some birth control pills, hormone replacement therapy, erythropoietin, tamoxifen, thalidomide). The risk of a blood clot is further increased in people who use one of these medications, and also have other risk factors. Surgery and related conditions — Surgical procedures, especially those involving the hip, pelvis, knee, brain, or spine, as well as trauma (especially if blood vessels are injured) increase a person's risk of developing a blood clot. During the recovery period, this risk often continues because the person is less active.","Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is primarily characterized by the formation of blood clots in the deep veins of the legs, thighs, or pelvis.",It is not true that pulmonary embolism (PE) is primarily caused by the dislodgment of blood clots from deep vein thrombosis.,"While many factors can increase the risk of DVT, the impact of inherited conditions on treatment outcomes remains unclear."

● Antiphospholipid antibodies (antibodies in the blood that can affect the clotting process) (see ""Patient education: The antiphospholipid syndrome (Beyond the Basics)"") Inherited thrombophilia — Inherited thrombophilia refers to a genetic problem that causes the blood to clot more easily than normal. Various factors in the blood clotting process may be involved, depending on the type of genetic problem present. An inherited thrombophilia is occasionally present in people with a venous blood clot (ie, thrombus). For example, deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C, or protein S can be found in less than 5 percent of patients who have had an unprovoked venous blood clot (a blood clot not caused by a medical or surgical condition). Other factors, such as factor V Leiden or the prothrombin gene mutation, can occur in approximately 20 to 25 percent of people with a venous blood clot. However, factor V Leiden or the prothrombin gene mutation is also found in up to 5 percent of otherwise healthy Caucasians. Venous thrombosis is infrequent before adolescence in people with inherited thrombophilia.

./UTD2txt/4881.txt,"In many cases, there are obvious risk factors such as recent surgery or immobility (see 'Acquired thrombophilia' above). In other cases, the clinician may test for the presence of an inherited form of thrombophilia or for another medical condition associated with an increased risk for venous thrombosis. (See 'Inherited thrombophilia' above.) Persons with some acquired or inherited abnormalities may require additional treatment or prevention measures to reduce the risk of another thrombosis. Some experts recommend that the family members of a person with an inherited thrombophilia be screened for the inherited condition if this information would affect their care as well, although this issue is controversial. It is important that the healthcare provider discusses the pros and cons of screening for an inherited thrombophilia with the patient before this testing is done. DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS TREATMENT — The treatment of DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) are similar. In DVT, the main goal of treatment is to prevent a PE. Other goals of treatment include preventing the clot from becoming larger, preventing new blood clots from forming, and preventing long-term complications of PE or DVT. The primary treatment for venous thrombosis is anticoagulation. Other available treatments, which may be used in specific situations, include thrombolytic therapy or placing a filter in a major blood vessel (the inferior vena cava). Anticoagulation — Anticoagulants are medications that are commonly called ""blood thinners."" They do not actually dissolve the clot, but rather help to prevent new blood clots from forming. There are several different medications that might be given after a DVT diagnosis (referred to as ""initial anticoagulation""), including:
● Low molecular weight heparin, which is given as an injection under the skin – Options include enoxaparin (brand name: Lovenox), dalteparin (brand name: Fragmin), and tinzaparin (brand name: Innohep). ● Fondaparinux (brand name: Arixtra), also given by injection
● Unfractionated heparin, which is given into a vein (intravenously) – This may be the preferred choice in certain circumstances, such as if the patient has severe kidney failure or unstable blood pressure. ● Direct oral anticoagulants – These are available in pill form; they include rivaroxaban (brand name: Xarelto) and apixaban (brand name: Eliquis). Initial anticoagulation is continued for 5 to 10 days. After that, long-term anticoagulation is continued for 3 to 12 months (see 'Duration of treatment' below). In most cases, the direct oral anticoagulants are the preferred choice for long-term anticoagulation; these pills include rivaroxaban (brand name: Xarelto), apixaban (brand name: Eliquis), dabigatran (brand name: Pradaxa), and edoxaban (brand name: Savaysa). In some situations, another oral medication called warfarin (sample brand name: Coumadin) is given instead. For patients taking warfarin, the clotting factors in the blood need to be measured on a regular basis with a blood test called the International Normalized Ratio (INR), whereas this is not needed for patients on direct oral anticoagulants (see ""Patient education: Warfarin (Coumadin) (Beyond the Basics)""). Less commonly, the patient does not take warfarin or any of the direct oral anticoagulants but takes a daily injection of low molecular weight heparin or fondaparinux for the entire treatment period. The choice of anticoagulant depends upon multiple factors, including the preference of the patient and the healthcare provider, the patient's medical history and other conditions, and cost considerations. Duration of treatment — Anticoagulation is recommended for a MINIMUM of three months in a patient with DVT. ● In patients who had a reversible risk factor contributing to their DVT, such as trauma, surgery, or being confined to bed for a prolonged period, the person is often treated with anticoagulation for three months or until the risk factor is resolved. ● Expert groups suggest that people who develop a venous thrombosis and who do not have a known risk factor for thrombosis may need treatment with an anticoagulant for an indefinite period of time [1]. However, this decision should be discussed with the person's healthcare provider after three months of treatment, and then reassessed on a regular basis. Some people prefer to continue the anticoagulant, which may carry an increased risk of bleeding, while others prefer to stop the anticoagulant at some point, which may carry an increased risk for repeat thrombosis. ● Most experts recommend continuing anticoagulation indefinitely for people with two or more episodes of venous thrombosis or if a permanent risk factor for clotting is present (eg, antiphospholipid syndrome, cancer). Walking during DVT treatment — Once an anticoagulant has been started and symptoms (eg, pain, swelling) are under control, the person is strongly encouraged to get up and walk around. Studies show that there is no increased risk of complications (eg, pulmonary embolus) in people who get up and walk, and walking may in fact help the person feel better faster.

There are several different medications that might be given after a DVT diagnosis (referred to as ""initial anticoagulation""), including:
● Low molecular weight heparin, which is given as an injection under the skin – Options include enoxaparin (brand name: Lovenox), dalteparin (brand name: Fragmin), and tinzaparin (brand name: Innohep). ● Fondaparinux (brand name: Arixtra), also given by injection
● Unfractionated heparin, which is given into a vein (intravenously) – This may be the preferred choice in certain circumstances, such as if the patient has severe kidney failure or unstable blood pressure. ● Direct oral anticoagulants – These are available in pill form; they include rivaroxaban (brand name: Xarelto) and apixaban (brand name: Eliquis). Initial anticoagulation is continued for 5 to 10 days. After that, long-term anticoagulation is continued for 3 to 12 months (see 'Duration of treatment' below). In most cases, the direct oral anticoagulants are the preferred choice for long-term anticoagulation; these pills include rivaroxaban (brand name: Xarelto), apixaban (brand name: Eliquis), dabigatran (brand name: Pradaxa), and edoxaban (brand name: Savaysa). In some situations, another oral medication called warfarin (sample brand name: Coumadin) is given instead. For patients taking warfarin, the clotting factors in the blood need to be measured on a regular basis with a blood test called the International Normalized Ratio (INR), whereas this is not needed for patients on direct oral anticoagulants (see ""Patient education: Warfarin (Coumadin) (Beyond the Basics)""). Less commonly, the patient does not take warfarin or any of the direct oral anticoagulants but takes a daily injection of low molecular weight heparin or fondaparinux for the entire treatment period. The choice of anticoagulant depends upon multiple factors, including the preference of the patient and the healthcare provider, the patient's medical history and other conditions, and cost considerations. Duration of treatment — Anticoagulation is recommended for a MINIMUM of three months in a patient with DVT. ● In patients who had a reversible risk factor contributing to their DVT, such as trauma, surgery, or being confined to bed for a prolonged period, the person is often treated with anticoagulation for three months or until the risk factor is resolved. ● Expert groups suggest that people who develop a venous thrombosis and who do not have a known risk factor for thrombosis may need treatment with an anticoagulant for an indefinite period of time [1]. However, this decision should be discussed with the person's healthcare provider after three months of treatment, and then reassessed on a regular basis. Some people prefer to continue the anticoagulant, which may carry an increased risk of bleeding, while others prefer to stop the anticoagulant at some point, which may carry an increased risk for repeat thrombosis. ● Most experts recommend continuing anticoagulation indefinitely for people with two or more episodes of venous thrombosis or if a permanent risk factor for clotting is present (eg, antiphospholipid syndrome, cancer). Walking during DVT treatment — Once an anticoagulant has been started and symptoms (eg, pain, swelling) are under control, the person is strongly encouraged to get up and walk around. Studies show that there is no increased risk of complications (eg, pulmonary embolus) in people who get up and walk, and walking may in fact help the person feel better faster. Thrombolytic therapy — In some cases, a healthcare provider will recommend an intravenous medicine to dissolve blood clots.",Walking is encouraged during DVT treatment as it does not increase the risk of complications and may aid in recovery.,Walking during DVT treatment significantly raises the chances of developing complications such as pulmonary embolism.,"Although studies suggest that walking is beneficial during DVT treatment, individual responses may vary based on specific health conditions."

Inferior vena cava filter — An inferior vena cava (IVC) filter is a device that blocks the circulation of clots in the bloodstream. It is placed in the inferior vena cava (the large vein leading from the lower body to the heart). The IVC filter typically is inserted through a small incision in a leg vein with the use of a local anesthetic and takes 20 to 30 minutes to perform. An IVC filter is often recommended in patients with venous thromboembolism who cannot use anticoagulants because of a very high bleeding risk.

DEEP VEIN THROMBOSIS PREVENTIONHospitalized patients — Certain high risk patients who are in the hospital, either for surgery (especially bone or joint surgery and cancer surgery) or because of a serious medical illness, may be given anticoagulants to decrease the risk of blood clots. Anticoagulants may also be given to women at high risk for venous thrombosis during and after pregnancy. (See 'Deep vein thrombosis risk factors' above.) In hospitalized patients with a moderate to low risk of blood clots, other preventive measures may be used. For example, some surgical patients are fitted with inflatable compression devices that are worn around the legs during and immediately after surgery and periodically fill with air. These devices apply gentle pressure to improve circulation and help prevent clots. Graduated compression stockings may also be recommended; these stockings apply pressure to the lower legs, with the greatest pressure at the ankle. The pressure gradually decreases up to the knee. For all patients, walking as soon as possible after surgery can decrease the risk of a blood clot.

In general, the choice of treatment is influenced by stage, histologic grade, and tumor size. SURGERY — Surgery represents the only potentially curative modality for breast sarcomas. The type and extent of the operation is based upon both the size of the tumor and the size of the breast, as well as histology:
● An adequate resection margin is the single most important determinant of long-term survival with breast sarcomas [2-4]. For larger tumors (ie, those >5 cm), the overall cosmetic result is often better with a mastectomy and reconstruction than with lumpectomy. Deep-seated tumors, which are close to or involve the chest wall, may require en bloc resection of the chest wall [3,5,6]. With the exception of angiosarcomas, the majority of primary breast sarcomas are not multicentric [2], and negative surgical margins are more important than the extent of surgical resection [2,7-9]. Breast angiosarcomas (primary or therapy-related) often affect a much larger field of the breast or chest wall than anticipated, and mastectomy is the standard treatment [10,11]. ● A study of 100 cases of angiosarcoma treated with breast-conserving therapy demonstrated that the majority of patients recurred locally within one year (73 percent) [12]. Angiosarcomas often have infiltrative cutaneous disease that extends well beyond the visible tumor, and recurrences are often seen at the margins of the prior operation in a shotgun pellet pattern. Accordingly, special attention should be given to ensuring the skin margin is clear and margins of 3 cm have been proposed [13]. Hence, the authors prefer a mastectomy rather than breast conservation surgery for this histology. Furthermore, given the high risk of recurrence with this histology, reconstruction should generally be delayed. In many cases, the wide excision of skin that is necessary to achieve negative margins precludes closure and requires a skin graft or myocutaneous flap. It is often wise to employ temporary coverage until the margin status on final pathology is known and perform definitive coverage in a delayed fashion. Frozen section analysis of the margins can be inaccurate as angiosarcomas tend to have low-grade changes at the margins that can be difficult to differentiate from radiation changes [14].","Due to the rarity of breast sarcomas, treatment recommendations are primarily based on small retrospective case reviews and insights from nonbreast soft tissue sarcoma studies.","Surgery is not considered the only potentially curative modality for breast sarcomas, as other treatments can also lead to successful outcomes.","While an adequate resection margin is crucial for long-term survival, the extent of surgical resection may vary based on individual tumor characteristics."

ADJUVANT RADIATION THERAPYPrimary breast sarcomas — The high rate of local recurrence after surgery alone (up to one-third in some series [16,23-25]) provides the rationale for postoperative radiation therapy (RT). The benefit of adjuvant RT for the treatment of primary breast sarcomas is controversial. There are no randomized trials that have been conducted in this subgroup, and the available observational series, mostly summarizing the experience of single institutions, provide conflicting data [5,7,8,16,21,26-29]. While some have found no benefit for adjuvant RT [5,16,21,26,29,30], others suggest improved outcomes, particularly for large, high-grade breast sarcomas [2,7,15,23,27,31]. Most of the benefit seems to be in reducing rates of locoregional recurrence; the impact on overall survival remains uncertain [2,7,8,26,31]. As an example, in a systematic review of 74 articles reporting on 222 patients, those managed with surgical resection and radiation therapy (n = 38) had a better local recurrence-free interval compared with patients managed by surgical resection alone (n = 151, 57 versus 34 percent) [31]. Other data to support benefit for RT in conjunction with surgery for primary breast sarcoma are extrapolated from randomized trials conducted in patients with nonbreast soft tissue sarcomas, which uniformly demonstrate improvement in local control but without an impact on survival. (See ""Overview of multimodality treatment for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and chest wall"", section on 'Radiation therapy'.) A preference for preoperative as compared with postoperative external beam RT in patients with extremity sarcoma is based upon results from a randomized Canadian trial that demonstrated similar efficacy but a lower rate of generally irreversible late complications with preoperative therapy, including grade 3 to 4 fibrosis. None of the patients in this trial had primary breast sarcoma, and whether these benefits can be extrapolated to patients with breast sarcomas is unclear. These data are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Overview of multimodality treatment for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and chest wall"", section on 'Preoperative versus postoperative RT'.) Summary — The benefit of adjuvant RT for primary (de novo) breast sarcomas has not been proven in randomized trials. However, data extrapolated from randomized trials conducted in patients with extremity sarcomas suggest that RT reduces the rate of local recurrence, especially for high-grade or large tumors, which are associated with a higher rate of local recurrence. Our recommendations for adjuvant RT in patients with breast sarcoma parallel those for extremity sarcomas (see ""Overview of multimodality treatment for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and chest wall"", section on 'Guidelines from expert groups'):
● We suggest RT for breast sarcomas >5 cm, especially if high-grade, and for patients with positive margins in whom reresection is not feasible. However, RT cannot compensate for inadequate surgery, and reexcision to ensure clean margins is strongly encouraged in these cases. For patients with large low-grade sarcomas, the risk to benefit ratio should be weighed carefully given the association of breast RT with long-term complications. ● Adjuvant RT is also a reasonable option for selected patients with high-grade lesions between 2 and 5 cm (particularly aggressive tumors such as angiosarcomas in a previously unirradiated field). However, if wide margins (>1 cm) are achieved with mastectomy, the risk to benefit ratio should be weighed carefully given the association of breast RT with long-term complications. (See ""Patterns of relapse and long-term complications of therapy in breast cancer survivors"", section on 'Second cancers'.)
● For large, deep tumors where the surgeon expects close or positive margins, preoperative RT may be considered in an attempt to increase resectability. However, if the surgeon feels that adequate margins are likely to be obtained, we prefer surgery initially, reserving the decision regarding RT until after review of the final pathology from the resection specimen.

(See ""Adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities"", section on 'Pediatric-type sarcomas'.) However, despite many randomized trials, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy for the more common adult subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma (such as liposarcoma, synovial sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and angiosarcoma), including those that arise within the breast, is uncertain. Pooled analyses from multiple studies provide the largest amount of patient data; however, they remain difficult to interpret based on inclusion of soft tissue sarcoma of differing grades, sites, and histologies as well as disparities in treatment used. (See ""Adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities"".)
● An analysis from the Sarcoma Meta-Analysis Collaboration (SMAC) suggests a significant 11 percent improvement in survival for doxorubicin and ifosfamide-based adjuvant chemotherapy compared with resection alone [36]. ● However, a pooled analysis of individual patient data from the two largest adjuvant trials of doxorubicin and ifosfamide-based chemotherapy (both performed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC], only one of which was included in the SMAC meta-analysis) was negative for any survival advantage. (See ""Adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities"", section on 'Pooled analysis of the EORTC trials'.)

./UTD2txt/2228.txt,"If these patients have high-grade tumors, regardless of size (although typically over at least 3 cm), adjuvant chemotherapy is sometimes offered to improve local control when usual measures are not possible. These general treatment principles are in keeping with consensus-based guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) [40], which suggest that the appropriateness of adjuvant chemotherapy be addressed on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the patient's performance status, comorbid factors (including age), disease location, tumor size, and histologic subtype. (See ""Adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities"", section on 'Summary and recommendations'.) Summary — Adjuvant chemotherapy cannot be recommended routinely after resection of a breast sarcoma. The appropriateness of adjuvant chemotherapy must be addressed on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the patient's performance status, comorbid factors (including age), disease location, tumor size, and histologic subtype. Adjuvant chemotherapy is a reasonable option for patients with high-risk primary (stage III, as defined by TNM staging system ) or recurrent sarcomas, and because of their worse outcome, for angiosarcomas between 3 and 5 cm in size. In all of these settings, the potential for benefit must be discussed in the context and potential of expected treatment-related toxicities including sterility in younger individuals, cardiomyopathy (particularly in patients with therapy-related breast sarcomas, who may have received prior doxorubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy), renal damage, second cancers, and overall impairment of quality of life. (See ""Adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities"", section on 'Sarcomas more commonly seen in adults' and ""Clinical manifestations, monitoring, and diagnosis of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity"" and ""Prevention and management of anthracycline cardiotoxicity"".) In general, when chemotherapy is indicated based upon consideration of all patient-specific factors, a neoadjuvant rather than adjuvant approach is often preferred to allow for an in vivo response assessment and the potential for improved surgical outcomes (see 'Neoadjuvant therapy for large, locally advanced, initially unresectable lesions' below). When adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is chosen, we use the combination of doxorubicin plus ifosfamide, but in a patient with a treatment-related angiosarcoma who has received prior anthracycline-based chemotherapy, a taxane-containing regimen is an appropriate option. (See ""Adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities"", section on 'Summary and recommendations'.) NEOADJUVANT THERAPY FOR LARGE, LOCALLY ADVANCED, INITIALLY UNRESECTABLE LESIONS — Given the importance of negative surgical margins for local control and survival, neoadjuvant therapy may increase the likelihood of successful surgical resection for large high-grade breast sarcomas. There are no data from randomized trials or large retrospective reviews on preoperative radiation therapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy for breast sarcomas; in the setting of extremity and chest wall sarcomas, the specific neoadjuvant approach (RT alone, concurrent chemoradiotherapy, or sequential chemotherapy followed by RT) depends upon institutional expertise and experience. For large, deep-seated tumors where the surgeon expects close or positive margins, preoperative treatment may be preferred over initial surgery in an attempt to improve resectability and the likelihood of achieving negative margins. (See ""Treatment of locally recurrent and unresectable, locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities"", section on 'Radiation therapy and chemoradiotherapy'.) Chemotherapy alone has been proposed as an effective strategy for neoadjuvant therapy of breast sarcomas, but there is a lack of prospective data to support this approach [9]. Furthermore, as noted above, concerns have been raised given that chemotherapy response rates in breast sarcomas are limited and not durable [2]. Chemotherapy with local hyperthermia has also been proposed for the management of locally advanced, high-risk, and recurrent breast sarcoma [41]. A European randomized trial reported benefit from the addition of regional hyperthermia to neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone among patients with large high-grade tumors or initially unresectable disease involving the extremities or nonextremity sites (of which only 18 percent arose on the trunk). Whether benefit can be extrapolated to large, locally advanced breast sarcomas is uncertain. This approach, which is not widely used outside of Europe, is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Treatment of locally recurrent and unresectable, locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities"", section on 'Chemotherapy with regional hyperthermia'.) Summary — Decisions about neoadjuvant therapy for patients with large, locally advanced or recurrent breast sarcomas should be made on a case-by-case basis, and these decisions are best made within a multidisciplinary group of sarcoma experts. In some cases (eg, locally unresectable or borderline resectable tumors), neoadjuvant RT may be preferred over chemotherapy given the risk of progression on chemotherapy. Alternatively, in the case of a radiation-associated sarcoma, additional RT may not be an option and thus chemotherapy (with regional hyperthermia, where available) or an initial surgical approach may be favored. When neoadjuvant chemotherapy is chosen, we often use taxanes for angiosarcoma and the combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide for other histologies. OUTCOMES — Five-year disease-free survival rates for breast sarcomas range from 44 to 66 percent, and five-year overall survival rates are between 49 and 67 percent [2,7,20,22,24,39,42,43].",Adjuvant chemotherapy is sometimes recommended for patients with high-grade tumors to enhance local control when standard treatments are insufficient.,Routine adjuvant chemotherapy is always recommended after resection of a breast sarcoma.,"While chemotherapy is often proposed as a neoadjuvant therapy for breast sarcomas, its effectiveness remains uncertain due to a lack of supporting data."

Adjuvant chemotherapy is a reasonable option for patients with high-risk primary (stage III, as defined by TNM staging system ) or recurrent sarcomas, and because of their worse outcome, for angiosarcomas between 3 and 5 cm in size. In all of these settings, the potential for benefit must be discussed in the context and potential of expected treatment-related toxicities including sterility in younger individuals, cardiomyopathy (particularly in patients with therapy-related breast sarcomas, who may have received prior doxorubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy), renal damage, second cancers, and overall impairment of quality of life. (See ""Adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities"", section on 'Sarcomas more commonly seen in adults' and ""Clinical manifestations, monitoring, and diagnosis of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity"" and ""Prevention and management of anthracycline cardiotoxicity"".) In general, when chemotherapy is indicated based upon consideration of all patient-specific factors, a neoadjuvant rather than adjuvant approach is often preferred to allow for an in vivo response assessment and the potential for improved surgical outcomes (see 'Neoadjuvant therapy for large, locally advanced, initially unresectable lesions' below). When adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is chosen, we use the combination of doxorubicin plus ifosfamide, but in a patient with a treatment-related angiosarcoma who has received prior anthracycline-based chemotherapy, a taxane-containing regimen is an appropriate option. (See ""Adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities"", section on 'Summary and recommendations'.) NEOADJUVANT THERAPY FOR LARGE, LOCALLY ADVANCED, INITIALLY UNRESECTABLE LESIONS — Given the importance of negative surgical margins for local control and survival, neoadjuvant therapy may increase the likelihood of successful surgical resection for large high-grade breast sarcomas. There are no data from randomized trials or large retrospective reviews on preoperative radiation therapy (RT) or chemoradiotherapy for breast sarcomas; in the setting of extremity and chest wall sarcomas, the specific neoadjuvant approach (RT alone, concurrent chemoradiotherapy, or sequential chemotherapy followed by RT) depends upon institutional expertise and experience. For large, deep-seated tumors where the surgeon expects close or positive margins, preoperative treatment may be preferred over initial surgery in an attempt to improve resectability and the likelihood of achieving negative margins. (See ""Treatment of locally recurrent and unresectable, locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities"", section on 'Radiation therapy and chemoradiotherapy'.) Chemotherapy alone has been proposed as an effective strategy for neoadjuvant therapy of breast sarcomas, but there is a lack of prospective data to support this approach [9]. Furthermore, as noted above, concerns have been raised given that chemotherapy response rates in breast sarcomas are limited and not durable [2]. Chemotherapy with local hyperthermia has also been proposed for the management of locally advanced, high-risk, and recurrent breast sarcoma [41]. A European randomized trial reported benefit from the addition of regional hyperthermia to neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone among patients with large high-grade tumors or initially unresectable disease involving the extremities or nonextremity sites (of which only 18 percent arose on the trunk). Whether benefit can be extrapolated to large, locally advanced breast sarcomas is uncertain. This approach, which is not widely used outside of Europe, is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See ""Treatment of locally recurrent and unresectable, locally advanced soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities"", section on 'Chemotherapy with regional hyperthermia'.) Summary — Decisions about neoadjuvant therapy for patients with large, locally advanced or recurrent breast sarcomas should be made on a case-by-case basis, and these decisions are best made within a multidisciplinary group of sarcoma experts. In some cases (eg, locally unresectable or borderline resectable tumors), neoadjuvant RT may be preferred over chemotherapy given the risk of progression on chemotherapy. Alternatively, in the case of a radiation-associated sarcoma, additional RT may not be an option and thus chemotherapy (with regional hyperthermia, where available) or an initial surgical approach may be favored. When neoadjuvant chemotherapy is chosen, we often use taxanes for angiosarcoma and the combination of doxorubicin and ifosfamide for other histologies. OUTCOMES — Five-year disease-free survival rates for breast sarcomas range from 44 to 66 percent, and five-year overall survival rates are between 49 and 67 percent [2,7,20,22,24,39,42,43].",Decisions regarding neoadjuvant therapy for breast sarcomas should be made collaboratively among a multidisciplinary team.,Neoadjuvant therapy decisions should be made unilaterally by the primary oncologist without input from other specialists.,"While five-year disease-free survival rates for breast sarcomas vary, the actual impact of treatment approaches on these rates is complex and not fully understood."
./UTD2txt/2228.txt,"As with soft tissue sarcomas arising elsewhere in the body, the prognosis for breast sarcomas is highly dependent upon histologic grade and tumor size; these factors determine disease stage  [2,7,15,18,20,21,42,44]. The association of grade and tumor size with outcome in primary (nontherapy-related) breast sarcomas can be illustrated by a series of 90 patients, in which the 10-year survival rates for grade 1, 2, and 3 tumors were 82, 62, and 36 percent, respectively [2]. The corresponding 10-year survival rates for tumors <5 cm, 5 to 10 cm, and >10 cm were 76, 68, and 28 percent, respectively. The influence of histologic grade on outcomes for angiosarcomas of the breast is less clear. Although some series indicate a better prognosis for low-grade tumors [21,30,45,46], others do not [25,47]; histologic grading is generally not recommended for angiosarcomas. Given their poor clinical outcomes, they are all considered to represent high-grade (grade 3/3) tumors. (See ""Breast sarcoma: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging"", section on 'Histologic classification'.) Positive surgical margins increase the risk for local recurrence and death [3,7,16,21,23,42]. Adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) does not compensate for inadequate surgery, and reexcision to ensure clean margins is strongly encouraged in these cases. (See 'Adjuvant radiation therapy' above.) Histologic subtype does not influence prognosis with the exception of angiosarcoma [2,7,20]. (See 'Angiosarcoma' below.) Radiation-induced sarcomas often present at an advanced clinical stage and are reported to have a worse clinical outcome than sporadic breast sarcomas. This is at least in part because the diagnosis is difficult to make in an irradiated breast and because angiosarcomas, which are the predominant subtype, have a particularly poor prognosis (see 'Angiosarcoma' below). However, in one study, the significantly lower disease-free survival rates in radiation-induced as compared with sporadic sarcomas were independent of histologic subtype [48]. Angiosarcoma — Angiosarcomas metastasize early, most often to the lung and liver. They also metastasize to bones, brain, skin, and the contralateral breast, which are unusual locations for other soft tissue sarcomas [30,49]. In most (but not all [16,18]) series, angiosarcomas have a worse prognosis than do other histologies [2,15,22,26,39,44,49-54]. As an example, in the SArcoma and PHYllode Retrospective (SAPHYR) study, the three-year disease-free and overall survival rates for the 17 patients with primary angiosarcomas were 7 and 23 percent, respectively [39]. In contrast, the three-year disease-free and overall survival rates for the 27 nonangiosarcoma primary breast sarcomas were 45 and 60 percent, respectively. These data are consistent with the relative risk of metastases for these two sarcoma subtypes. With more aggressive resection and increased use of multimodality therapy, outcomes may be slightly better, although the available data are limited [44,55]. As an example, in a retrospective series of 55 women with breast angiosarcoma (23 radiation-associated, 32 primary), the two- and five-year overall survival rates were 64 and 38 percent, respectively [44]. These better outcomes may be attributable to case mix. In many series, patients who develop angiosarcomas in radiation or lymphedema fields are more prone to local and distant recurrence and death from disease than are those who have primary angiosarcoma, even if they undergo a microscopically complete (R0) resection [53,56]. As an example, in one series of 31 patients with a radiation-related breast angiosarcoma who underwent surgery, R0 resection was possible in 23 [56]. However, local recurrence occurred after a median of six months in 19 (83 percent), and regional or distant recurrences developed in 13 (57 percent).","The prognosis for breast sarcomas is primarily influenced by histologic grade and tumor size, which are critical factors in determining disease stage.",Histologic grading is generally recommended for angiosarcomas despite evidence suggesting it has no significant influence on prognosis.,"While some studies show that low-grade angiosarcomas may have a better prognosis, other studies present conflicting results, making it unclear how grade affects outcomes."
