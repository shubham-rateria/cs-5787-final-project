Toxicities associated with oral corticosteroids (OCS) are well described. Targeted biologics for severe asthma (SA) substantially reduce OCS exposure with the potential to reduce cumulative OCS-toxicities. The Glucocorticoid Toxicity Index (GTI) systematically assesses OCS-related toxicity; the GTI aggregate improvement score (AIS) is a bidirectional measure of total toxicity change with a ... Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are regarded as the gold standard for studying causal relationships in medical research, however, their rigorous screening processes and stringent enrollment criteria circumscribe the characteristics of the populations represented within the trial and thus compromise external validity .This is a particularly notable issue in the context of pediatric asthma ...[0m
