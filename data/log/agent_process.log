Toxicities associated with oral corticosteroids (OCS) are well described. Targeted biologics for severe asthma (SA) substantially reduce OCS exposure with the potential to reduce cumulative OCS-toxicities. The Glucocorticoid Toxicity Index (GTI) systematically assesses OCS-related toxicity; the GTI aggregate improvement score (AIS) is a bidirectional measure of total toxicity change with a ...
